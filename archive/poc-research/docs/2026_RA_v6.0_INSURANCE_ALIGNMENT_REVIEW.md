**Date:** November 17, 2025
**Reviewer:** Senior Cyber Insurance Analyst
**Documents Reviewed:**
- 2026 RA Question Set v6.0 (53 questions)
- v5.0 to v6.0 Changes Summary
- Grading Methodology Executive Review R2

**Purpose:** Comprehensive insurance-focused review to ensure the 2026 Risk Assessment v6.0 accurately reflects current carrier requirements, claims risk factors, and insurance coverage denial patterns.

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment: STRONG with CRITICAL GAPS

The 2026 Risk Assessment v6.0 demonstrates strong alignment with insurance carrier requirements and has made significant improvements over v5.0 by restoring foundational CIS IG1 controls. However, the review identified **7 Critical findings** and **12 High Priority findings** that require immediate attention before the 2026 assessment cycle launch.

**Key Strengths:**
- TIER 1A controls (9 questions) accurately reflect universal carrier requirements (95%+ prevalence)
- MFA coverage is comprehensive (4 questions covering remote access, cloud, admin, critical systems)
- EDR/MDR requirement correctly positioned as TIER 1A with no antivirus fallback
- Backup protection requirements align with 2025 ransomware attack patterns
- Grade Ceiling methodology accurately predicts insurance outcomes

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. PAM (Q3.5) classified as TIER 1B should be TIER 1A based on 2025 carrier data (42% required, up from 36%)
2. Network segmentation missing from TIER framework despite 70% carrier requirement
3. Endpoint encryption (Q3.7) classified as TIER 1B should be TIER 1A for healthcare/HIPAA organizations
4. Phishing simulation testing frequency not specified (quarterly vs annual matters for carrier compliance)
5. Missing explicit question about account lockout policies (credential stuffing attack vector)
6. Missing explicit question about secure RDP configuration (58% ransomware claims start from VPN/firewall compromise)
7. Vulnerability scanning question does not address internal scanning (only external)

### Insurance Outcome Prediction Accuracy

**Current State:** Grade Ceiling methodology correctly predicts insurance outcomes for TIER 1A gaps but may understate severity for TIER 1B gaps that are actually emerging TIER 1A requirements.

**Example Scenario:**
- Organization missing network segmentation (currently Comprehensive tier)
- Assessment Grade: A (no ceiling applied)
- Actual Insurance Outcome: 70% of carriers require segmentation, likely restrictions or premium surcharge of 15-25%
- **Verdict:** Assessment suggests excellent insurability, reality shows moderate restrictions

## Detailed Findings

### CRITICAL FINDINGS

---

#### CRITICAL-1: PAM (Q3.5) Tier Misalignment

**Finding:** Privileged Access Management (Q3.5) is classified as TIER 1B but carrier data indicates it should be TIER 1A.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **2025 Data:** 42% of organizations reported that PAM was required to obtain cyber insurance policy, up from 36% in 2023 (BeyondTrust, 2025)
- **Trend:** This represents a 6-percentage-point increase in just 2 years, indicating rapid shift toward mandatory status
- **Forrester Research:** 80% of security breaches involve privileged credentials (keys, certificates, passwords, tokens)
- **Current Classification:** TIER 1B (60% prevalence cited in document)
- **Actual Prevalence:** 42% required (mandatory), additional carriers use for rate optimization

**Claims Impact:**
- Admin account compromise leads to lateral movement in 89% of attacks (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- Hamilton City case: Compromised credentials led to $18.4M total recovery costs
- PAM prevents credential-based lateral movement that enables ransomware encryption of entire networks

**Insurance Reality:**
While 42% prevalence does not technically meet the "95%+ universal" TIER 1A threshold, the control is fundamentally different from other TIER 1B controls:
- **Rising rapidly:** 6-point increase in 2 years suggests 60-70% prevalence by 2026-2027
- **Foundational defense:** Prevents lateral movement that makes ransomware catastrophic vs contained
- **Claims differentiation:** Organizations with PAM contain breaches 54 days faster (IBM 2024)
- **Emerging gate:** Some carriers now require PAM for preferred rates, others for eligibility

**Assessment Impact:**
- Organization without PAM can achieve Grade A if all TIER 1A controls present
- Grade Ceiling does not apply (PAM is TIER 1B, ceiling only for missing TIER 1B = Grade B max)
- Board sees "Grade A" despite missing control that 42% of carriers require
- **Current:** Grade A (100% Foundation, 97% Comprehensive) = "Excellent insurability"
- **Reality:** Restrictions from 42% of carriers, premium surcharge likely

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Reclassify Q3.5 (Privileged Access Management) from TIER 1B to TIER 1A based on:
1. 42% mandatory requirement prevalence (highest among TIER 1B controls)
2. Rapid growth trajectory (36% to 42% in 2 years)
3. Foundational role in preventing lateral movement (89% of attacks)
4. Claims cost differentiation (54-day faster containment)

**Alternative:** If maintaining TIER 1B classification, create "TIER 1B-Premium" designation that applies Grade B ceiling (not Grade A) to distinguish from other TIER 1B controls. This ensures organizations without PAM receive Grade B maximum, signaling material insurance impact.

**Category:** CRITICAL - TIER misalignment creates false confidence about insurability

---

#### CRITICAL-2: Network Segmentation Missing from TIER Framework

**Finding:** Network segmentation is not included in TIER 1A or TIER 1B frameworks despite 70% carrier requirement.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Prevalence:** Nearly 70% of organizations with cyber insurance say their provider requires network segmentation (Illumio, 2025)
- **Carriers:** Updated underwriting packages from major carriers now require segmentation for critical assets or endpoints
- **Premium Impact:** Some carriers offer premium reductions of 15-25% for organizations with proven microsegmentation capabilities
- **OT/Manufacturing:** Carriers applying coverage exclusions or premium surcharges for operations without demonstrated segmentation, monitoring, and incident response capabilities

**Assessment Coverage:**
- **Q4.6:** "Network segmentation" (Impact: 3, Comprehensive tier)
- **Classification:** Comprehensive (not TIER 1A or TIER 1B)
- **Implication:** Organization without network segmentation can achieve Grade A

**Claims Impact:**
- Network segmentation limits lateral movement during cyber attacks by isolating critical systems
- Prevents ransomware from spreading from initial compromise point to entire network
- Zero Trust Segmentation (ZTS) stops breach spread by shutting down pathways for lateral movement
- 44% of claims are rejected because businesses don't meet basic security thresholds (segmentation is one of them)

**Insurance Reality:**
- 70% prevalence exceeds TIER 1B threshold (50-95%)
- Should be classified as TIER 1B minimum
- Absence should trigger Grade B ceiling (missing TIER 1B control)
- Current classification allows Grade A despite 70% carrier requirement

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Reclassify Q4.6 (Network Segmentation) from Comprehensive to TIER 1B based on:
1. 70% carrier requirement prevalence (exceeds TIER 1B 50-95% threshold)
2. Premium discount/surcharge impact (15-25% differential)
3. Lateral movement prevention (fundamental ransomware defense)
4. Rising carrier mandate trend (especially OT/manufacturing/critical infrastructure)

**Enhancement:** Consider increasing Impact Rating from 3 to 5 based on lateral movement prevention role in ransomware attacks.

**Category:** CRITICAL - 70% prevalence control missing from TIER framework

---

#### CRITICAL-3: Endpoint Encryption Sector-Specific Gap (Healthcare/HIPAA)

**Finding:** Endpoint encryption (Q3.7) classified as TIER 1B "emerging requirement" but is mandatory for healthcare/HIPAA organizations.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **HIPAA Organizations:** Full-disk encryption is required by HIPAA breach notification rules
- **Healthcare Breaches:** Lost/stolen devices account for 16% of healthcare breaches (HHS Breach Portal)
- **Safe Harbor:** If device is encrypted, breach notification is not required under HIPAA (significant cost/reputation savings)
- **Built-in Tools:** BitLocker (Windows) and FileVault (Mac) are free and built-in, making this a low-cost control

**Current Classification:**
- **Q3.7:** "Endpoint device encryption (full-disk encryption on laptops/mobile devices)" - Impact: 5, TIER 1B
- **Evidence:** "HIPAA required, emerging carrier requirement"
- **Issue:** Document acknowledges HIPAA requirement but classifies as "emerging" for general population

**Sector-Specific Analysis:**

**Healthcare/HIPAA Organizations (Vitalant, religious healthcare facilities):**
- Missing endpoint encryption = HIPAA violation
- Lost laptop without encryption = mandatory breach notification to HHS and affected individuals
- Average breach notification cost: $245 per record (IBM 2024)
- 100-record laptop theft = $24,500 notification cost + reputational damage
- **Should be:** TIER 1A for healthcare sector

**K-12 Schools (Primary CyberPools membership):**
- Student data on unencrypted devices = FERPA implications
- Lost device = potential breach notification to parents
- Reputational damage in school communities
- **Current TIER 1B classification may be appropriate** for K-12

**Assessment Impact:**
- CyberPools serves healthcare organizations (Vitalant expansion)
- Healthcare org without endpoint encryption receives Grade B (missing TIER 1B control)
- **Actual Insurance Reality:** Uninsurable or severe restrictions due to HIPAA violation
- Grade B understates severity for healthcare sector

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Implement sector-specific TIER classification for Q3.7:
1. **Healthcare/HIPAA Organizations:** Classify Q3.7 as TIER 1A (mandatory HIPAA requirement)
2. **K-12/General Organizations:** Maintain Q3.7 as TIER 1B (emerging requirement)
3. **Assessment Logic:** Apply appropriate ceiling based on organization sector
4. **Grade Ceiling Impact:** Healthcare org missing Q3.7 receives Grade C maximum (missing TIER 1A), not Grade B

**Alternative:** Create "Sector-Critical" designation that applies TIER 1A ceiling for specific organization types. Document must clearly explain this distinction in member communications.

**Category:** CRITICAL - Sector-specific mandatory requirement not reflected in grading

---

#### CRITICAL-4: Phishing Simulation Testing Frequency Ambiguity

**Finding:** Q7.3 asks about "Phishing simulation testing" but does not specify required frequency, creating assessment inconsistency.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **The Trust:** Requires phishing testing (frequency not specified in public documentation)
- **Coalition:** Requires phishing simulations (best practice: quarterly)
- **Beazley:** Requires phishing testing as part of security awareness program
- **Industry Standard:** Organizations testing quarterly show 61% better breach containment (Coalition 2025)

**Current Question:**
- **Q7.3:** "Phishing simulation testing" (Impact: 5, TIER 1B)
- **Evidence:** "Organizations testing quarterly = 61% better containment"
- **Issue:** Question does not specify "quarterly" despite evidence citation

**Comparison with Q7.2:**
- **Q7.2:** "Security awareness training frequency (annual minimum, quarterly preferred)" - Impact: 5, TIER 1B
- **Q7.2 Success:** Explicitly states frequency expectations
- **Q7.3 Failure:** Does not state frequency, creating ambiguity

**Assessment Impact:**
- Organization running annual phishing test answers "Fully Implemented" (correct per question wording)
- Organization running quarterly phishing test answers "Fully Implemented" (also correct)
- **No differentiation** between annual (minimum acceptable) and quarterly (best practice)
- Grading does not distinguish between these two materially different security postures

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect quarterly phishing testing (not annual)
- Annual testing may be accepted but quarterly preferred for rate optimization
- Organizations with quarterly testing demonstrate commitment to continuous improvement
- Assessment should distinguish between these levels

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Revise Q7.3 to specify frequency:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Match Q7.2 structure
- **Current:** "Phishing simulation testing"
- **Revised:** "Phishing simulation testing frequency (quarterly minimum, monthly preferred)"

**Option 2:** Create two separate questions
- **Q7.3a:** "Does organization conduct phishing simulation testing?" (TIER 1B, binary gate)
- **Q7.3b:** "Phishing simulation testing frequency" (Comprehensive, distinguishes maturity)

**Option 3:** Clarify in assessment guidance
- Maintain current question wording
- Assessment guidance specifies: Fully = Quarterly+, Partial = Semi-annual or Annual, Not = No testing
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Category:** CRITICAL - Lack of specificity allows materially different practices to receive same score

---

#### CRITICAL-5: Missing Control - Account Lockout Policy

**Finding:** Assessment does not include explicit question about account lockout policies, despite credential stuffing being a major attack vector.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Attack Vector:** 47% of breaches involve stolen credentials (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- **Credential Stuffing:** Automated attacks try thousands of username/password combinations
- **Lockout Policies:** Prevent brute force attacks by temporarily locking accounts after failed login attempts
- **MFA Relationship:** Account lockout provides defense-in-depth even when MFA is bypassed or not implemented for all systems

**Current Coverage:**
- **Q2.3:** "Password policy (length, complexity, changes)" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Issue:** Password policy question does not address lockout policies
- **Gap:** No question about failed login attempt thresholds, lockout duration, or automated blocking

**Claims Impact:**
- Credential stuffing attacks target accounts without lockout policies
- Automated tools can try millions of password combinations against accounts
- Account lockout slows attackers and triggers security alerts
- Organizations without lockout policies experience higher rates of credential-based breaches

**Insurance Reality:**
- Not a universal carrier requirement (not TIER 1A)
- Considered foundational defense-in-depth (likely TIER 1B or Comprehensive)
- CIS Control 6.2: "Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory" includes account lockout as part of secure configuration
- NIST 800-63B: Recommends account lockout or rate limiting for authentication attempts

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Add new question for account lockout policies:

**Proposed Q2.11:** "Does the organization enforce account lockout policies that temporarily disable accounts after a defined number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout)?"
- **Impact:** 5 (prevents credential stuffing, automated brute force attacks)
- **Tier:** Comprehensive (foundational defense-in-depth, not universal carrier requirement)
- **Evidence:** Prevents brute force attacks, recommended by NIST 800-63B, CIS Control 6.2
- **Sector:** Applicable to all organizations (K-12, healthcare, religious)

**Alternative:** Enhance Q2.3 (Password policy) to include lockout policies as part of comprehensive password management assessment. Less preferable because it combines two distinct controls.

**Category:** CRITICAL - Missing foundational control that prevents credential-based attacks

---

#### CRITICAL-6: Missing Control - Secure RDP Configuration

**Finding:** Assessment does not include explicit question about Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) security, despite RDP being a primary ransomware entry point.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Attack Vector:** 58% of ransomware claims start from VPN/firewall compromise (Coalition 2025)
- **RDP Attacks:** Exposed RDP is one of the most common initial access vectors for ransomware
- **Shodan Searches:** Attackers use Shodan to find publicly exposed RDP endpoints
- **Credential Attacks:** RDP targeted by brute force and credential stuffing when exposed to internet

**Current Coverage:**
- **Q2.3:** "MFA for remote access/VPN" - TIER 1A (covers VPN, does not explicitly address RDP)
- **Q4.1:** "Firewall deployment (perimeter + segmentation)" - Comprehensive
- **Gap:** No explicit question about RDP configuration, exposure, or restrictions

**Claims Impact:**
- Exposed RDP without MFA = direct path for ransomware attackers
- Many organizations expose RDP to internet for remote support/access
- RDP attacks often succeed because:
  1. RDP exposed directly to internet (not behind VPN)
  2. Weak passwords on RDP accounts
  3. No MFA on RDP authentication
  4. No IP whitelisting or geofencing

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers assess RDP exposure in underwriting applications
- Organizations with internet-exposed RDP face higher premiums or restrictions
- Best practice: RDP only accessible via VPN with MFA, or IP whitelisting
- CISA Warning: "Secure RDP" is one of the top mitigations for ransomware

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Add new question for RDP security:

**Proposed Q4.15:** "If Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used, is it secured by one or more of the following: (1) Only accessible via VPN with MFA, (2) MFA required for RDP authentication, (3) IP whitelisting/geofencing, (4) Disabled or not exposed to internet?"
- **Impact:** 5 (prevents ransomware initial access, primary attack vector)
- **Tier:** TIER 1B (foundational defense, 58% ransomware attacks involve remote access compromise)
- **Evidence:** Coalition 2025 Cyber Threat Index (58% ransomware from VPN/firewall), CISA ransomware guidance
- **Assessment Logic:** Fully = One or more protections in place, Partial = RDP used but weak controls, Not = RDP exposed to internet without protection

**Alternative:** Enhance Q2.3 (MFA for remote access/VPN) to explicitly include RDP in the question text. Less preferable because it combines authentication (MFA) with configuration (RDP exposure/restrictions).

**Category:** CRITICAL - Missing control for primary ransomware attack vector (58% of claims)

---

#### CRITICAL-7: Vulnerability Scanning Scope Gap (Internal vs External)

**Finding:** Q4.5 asks about "External vulnerability scanning (quarterly)" but does not address internal vulnerability scanning.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **External Scanning:** Universal carrier requirement, explicitly required by The Trust
- **Internal Scanning:** Identifies vulnerabilities on internal network that external scanning cannot detect
- **Attack Vector:** After initial compromise, attackers scan internal network for unpatched systems to exploit for lateral movement
- **Coverage Gap:** External scanning only identifies internet-facing vulnerabilities, misses internal infrastructure weaknesses

**Current Question:**
- **Q4.5:** "External vulnerability scanning (quarterly)" - Impact: 5, TIER 1A
- **Evidence:** "Identifies internet-facing risks before exploitation. The Trust requirement."
- **Issue:** Only addresses external scanning, no question about internal scanning

**Claims Impact:**
- Ransomware attackers who gain initial access via phishing, VPN compromise, or other means then pivot to internal network reconnaissance
- Unpatched internal systems (servers, workstations, network devices) become targets for lateral movement
- External scanning would not detect these internal vulnerabilities
- Organizations with external-only scanning have false confidence in vulnerability management

**Insurance Reality:**
- External scanning is universal requirement (TIER 1A correct)
- Internal scanning is emerging best practice (likely TIER 1B or Comprehensive)
- CIS Control 7.5: "Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets" (IG2)
- Carriers may ask about internal scanning in applications but not universally required

**CIS IG1 vs IG2 Classification:**
- **CIS 7.1:** Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process (IG1)
- **CIS 7.4:** Perform Automated Application Patch Management (IG1)
- **CIS 7.5:** Perform Automated Vulnerability Scans of Internal Enterprise Assets (IG2)
- **Implication:** Internal scanning is IG2, not IG1, so Comprehensive tier may be appropriate

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Add new question for internal vulnerability scanning:

**Proposed Q4.16:** "Does the organization perform internal vulnerability scanning of enterprise assets (servers, workstations, network devices) at least quarterly?"
- **Impact:** 5 (identifies internal vulnerabilities exploited during lateral movement)
- **Tier:** Comprehensive (CIS IG2, not universal carrier requirement but emerging best practice)
- **Evidence:** CIS Control 7.5 (IG2), prevents lateral movement exploitation of unpatched internal systems
- **Assessment Logic:** Fully = Quarterly or more frequent internal scanning, Partial = Annual or ad-hoc scanning, Not = No internal scanning

**Alternative:** Revise Q4.5 to include both external and internal scanning:
- **Current:** "External vulnerability scanning (quarterly)"
- **Revised:** "Vulnerability scanning (external quarterly minimum, internal quarterly preferred)"
- Less preferable because it combines two distinct control maturity levels (TIER 1A external + Comprehensive internal)

**Category:** CRITICAL - Scope gap creates false confidence in vulnerability management coverage

---

### HIGH PRIORITY FINDINGS

---

#### HIGH-1: Email Authentication (Q5.4) Evidence Update Needed

**Finding:** Q5.4 (Email authentication SPF/DKIM/DMARC) is classified as TIER 1B but carrier prevalence may be higher based on 2025 data.

**Carrier Evidence - 2025 Updates:**
- **Cyber Insurance Applications:** Underwriters now ask "Have you implemented any of the following to protect against phishing messages: SPF, DKIM, DMARC?" (dmarcian, 2025)
- **Insurance Impact:** "Not checking the DMARC box on a cyber insurance application is viewed as a liability by insurers, and the lack of DMARC can lead to higher premium or lack of payout after breach" (dmarcian, 2025)
- **Compliance Trend:** "Setting up DMARC is quickly becoming a compliance checkbox for data security audits, insurance underwriting, and vendor risk reviews" (dmarcian, 2025)
- **Coalition:** Explicitly asks about email authentication in applications (Coalition, 2024)
- **Chubb:** Includes email security controls in underwriting assessment (Chubb, 2024)

**Current Classification:**
- **Q5.4:** "Email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)" - Impact: 5, TIER 1B
- **Evidence:** "39% cloud incidents involve BEC [20]. Prevents domain spoofing/impersonation. Coalition [13], Chubb [27], emerging standard."
- **Prevalence:** Document suggests emerging requirement, TIER 1B appropriate (50-95%)

**Updated Assessment:**
- Email authentication is now standard question on cyber insurance applications (not just emerging)
- Absence leads to higher premiums or claim denial risk
- Trend shows rapid shift from "nice to have" to "expected baseline"
- **2025 Reality:** Likely 60-80% prevalence (upper end of TIER 1B)

**Claims Impact:**
- 39% of cloud incidents involve business email compromise (IBM 2024)
- Email domain spoofing enables phishing attacks that lead to credential theft and ransomware
- Organizations without DMARC enforcement experience higher rates of successful phishing attacks using their own domain

**Recommendation:**
**MONITOR:** Q5.4 classification as TIER 1B is currently appropriate based on 50-95% prevalence threshold, but control is at upper end of range and trending toward TIER 1A.

**Action for 2027 Assessment:** Re-evaluate Q5.4 for potential reclassification to TIER 1A if:
1. Prevalence data shows 80%+ carrier requirement by 2026
2. Evidence of claim denials specifically due to missing DMARC/email authentication
3. Major carriers (Travelers, AIG, Chubb) make DMARC mandatory vs. preferred

**Update Evidence:** Revise Q5.4 evidence statement to reflect 2025 market reality:
- **Current:** "Coalition [13], Chubb [27], emerging standard"
- **Suggested:** "Coalition [13], Chubb [27], standard insurance application question. Absence results in premium increase or claim denial risk (dmarcian, 2025)"

**Category:** HIGH - TIER 1B classification accurate but control approaching TIER 1A threshold

---

#### HIGH-2: Backup Testing Specificity (Q6.3)

**Finding:** Q6.3 asks about "Backup testing frequency" but does not specify full restoration testing vs. basic verification.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **The Trust:** Requires backup testing (frequency and methodology matter)
- **Coalition:** Requires tested backups (full restoration preferred)
- **Industry Data:** 62% of untested backups fail at restoration (Rubrik 2024)
- **Insurance Impact:** Backup testing failures discovered during ransomware incidents result in claim complications

**Current Question:**
- **Q6.3:** "Backup testing frequency" - Impact: 5, TIER 1A
- **Evidence:** "62% untested backups fail at restoration [2d]. Backup failure = claim denial risk."
- **Issue:** Question does not distinguish between "verification testing" (checking that backup job completed) and "restoration testing" (actually restoring data and verifying usability)

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization that runs monthly backup verification reports answers "Fully Implemented"
- Organization that performs quarterly full restoration testing also answers "Fully Implemented"
- These are materially different practices with different failure rates

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect restoration testing, not just verification
- Verification testing proves backup ran, not that data is recoverable
- Restoration testing proves data can be recovered and is usable
- Some organizations discover backup failures only during ransomware incidents (when verification testing gave false confidence)

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Revise Q6.3 to specify restoration testing:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Clarify question wording
- **Current:** "Backup testing frequency"
- **Revised:** "Backup restoration testing frequency (quarterly minimum, verifying that backed-up data can be successfully restored and is usable)"

**Option 2:** Add assessment guidance
- Maintain current question
- Assessment guidance specifies: Fully = Quarterly restoration testing, Partial = Annual restoration or monthly verification only, Not = No testing
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Category:** HIGH - Lack of specificity allows inadequate testing practices to receive full credit

---

#### HIGH-3: EDR/MDR Implementation Depth (Q5.3)

**Finding:** Q5.3 asks about "EDR/MDR deployment" but does not assess deployment completeness or monitoring responsiveness.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Universal Requirement:** EDR is mandatory for cyber insurance (Coalition, Travelers, Chubb, AIG, all major carriers)
- **MDR Preference:** Some carriers prefer Managed Detection and Response (24/7 monitoring with response) over standalone EDR
- **Deployment Scope:** Carriers expect EDR on all endpoints (servers and workstations), not partial deployment
- **False Sense of Security:** Organizations with EDR deployed but not properly configured or monitored receive false confidence

**Current Question:**
- **Q5.3:** "EDR/MDR deployment" - Impact: 5, TIER 1A
- **Evidence:** "EDR = 92% ransomware detection rate [2]. Universal carrier requirement as of 2025. Traditional antivirus no longer acceptable for insurance coverage."
- **Issue:** Question does not assess deployment completeness (all endpoints? servers? workstations?) or monitoring effectiveness

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization with EDR on 60% of endpoints answers "Partially Implemented" (correct)
- Organization with EDR on 100% of endpoints but no monitoring/response capability answers "Fully Implemented" (technically correct but insurance-incomplete)
- No distinction between EDR (tool installed) and MDR (tool installed + 24/7 monitoring/response)

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect comprehensive deployment (100% of in-scope endpoints)
- Some carriers prefer or require MDR (24/7 SOC monitoring) for larger organizations
- Partial deployment or deployment without monitoring reduces detection effectiveness
- CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender are commonly accepted EDR platforms

**Recommendation:**
**ENHANCE:** Revise Q5.3 to assess deployment completeness and monitoring:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Multi-part question with deployment scope and monitoring
- **Current:** "EDR/MDR deployment"
- **Revised:** "EDR or MDR deployed on all in-scope endpoints (servers and workstations) with active threat monitoring"
- **Assessment Logic:**
  - Fully = EDR/MDR on 100% of in-scope endpoints with active monitoring
  - Partial = EDR/MDR on 75-99% of endpoints OR 100% without active monitoring
  - Not = EDR/MDR on <75% of endpoints OR traditional antivirus only

**Option 2:** Add separate question for monitoring
- **Q5.3:** "EDR/MDR deployment" (current question, focuses on presence)
- **New Q5.3a:** "EDR/MDR monitoring and response capability" (assesses monitoring effectiveness)
- More complex but provides granular assessment

**Option 3:** Add assessment guidance
- Maintain current question
- Assessment guidance clarifies: Fully = 100% deployment with monitoring, Partial = incomplete deployment or no monitoring, Not = no EDR/MDR
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Category:** HIGH - Question does not assess deployment completeness or monitoring effectiveness

---

#### HIGH-4: MFA Phishing-Resistant Requirement (Q2.3-2.6)

**Finding:** MFA questions do not distinguish between standard MFA (SMS, authenticator app) and phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2, hardware tokens, certificate-based).

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **CISA Guidance:** "Phishing-resistant MFA" is stronger and recommended for critical systems (CISA Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals)
- **Microsoft 2025:** "Phishing-resistant MFA blocks 99% of identity attacks" (Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2025)
- **Insurance Trend:** Some carriers now ask specifically about phishing-resistant MFA methods
- **2025 Reality:** Standard MFA (SMS, app) is baseline, phishing-resistant MFA is emerging premium requirement

**Current Questions:**
- **Q2.3-2.6:** "MFA for [remote access/cloud services/administrative accounts/critical systems]" - All TIER 1A
- **Evidence:** Cites phishing-resistant MFA benefits but does not require it in question
- **Issue:** Organization with SMS-based MFA answers "Fully Implemented" (meets baseline), organization with FIDO2 hardware keys also answers "Fully Implemented" (exceeds baseline)

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- SMS-based MFA is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks and phishing
- Authenticator app MFA is stronger but still vulnerable to sophisticated phishing (MFA fatigue attacks)
- FIDO2/hardware token MFA is phishing-resistant and represents gold standard
- Current questions do not distinguish between these materially different security postures

**Insurance Reality:**
- Standard MFA (SMS, app) meets current carrier baseline requirements
- Phishing-resistant MFA is emerging requirement for high-value or high-risk organizations
- Not yet universal requirement (not appropriate for TIER 1A mandatory classification)
- Likely appropriate for future differentiation in grading (premium vs. baseline)

**Recommendation:**
**MONITOR:** MFA method differentiation is not necessary for 2026 assessment cycle because:
1. Standard MFA meets current carrier baseline (95%+ prevalence)
2. Phishing-resistant MFA is emerging requirement, not universal
3. SMS-based MFA is significantly better than no MFA (blocking 99.9% of attacks per Microsoft)

**Action for 2027-2028 Assessment:** Consider adding phishing-resistant MFA assessment:

**Option A:** Add bonus/premium tier
- Maintain current Q2.3-2.6 as TIER 1A baseline (any MFA method)
- Add optional question: "Does organization use phishing-resistant MFA methods (FIDO2, hardware tokens, certificate-based) for administrative and critical system access?"
- Treat as "beyond baseline" for grade enhancement (A → A+ consideration)

**Option B:** Specify in question
- Revise Q2.5 (MFA for administrative accounts): "MFA for administrative accounts (phishing-resistant methods preferred: FIDO2, hardware tokens, certificate-based)"
- Assessment Logic: Fully = Phishing-resistant MFA, Partial = Standard MFA (SMS, app), Not = No MFA
- Risk: May penalize organizations with strong standard MFA implementations

**Recommended Approach:** Monitor carrier requirement evolution. If phishing-resistant MFA reaches 50%+ prevalence by 2027, add as separate assessment dimension.

**Category:** HIGH - Future consideration, not immediate action required for 2026

---

#### HIGH-5: Security Awareness Training Content Quality (Q7.2)

**Finding:** Q7.2 assesses training frequency but not training content quality or relevance.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **The Trust:** Requires security awareness training (annual minimum)
- **Coalition:** Requires training that covers phishing, password security, social engineering
- **Industry Standard:** Effective training covers current threat landscape, organization-specific risks
- **Compliance:** Many regulatory frameworks specify training content topics (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

**Current Question:**
- **Q7.2:** "Security awareness training frequency (annual minimum, quarterly preferred)" - Impact: 5, TIER 1B
- **Evidence:** "Users = #1 attack vector. Annual minimum required, quarterly preferred."
- **Issue:** Question only assesses frequency, not content quality or coverage

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization with quarterly training using outdated content answers "Fully Implemented"
- Organization with annual training using current, relevant, engaging content also answers "Fully Implemented"
- No assessment of whether training covers critical topics (phishing, password security, social engineering, data handling, incident reporting)

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect training to cover specific threat topics
- Outdated or generic training provides limited risk reduction
- Effective training is frequent AND relevant
- Some carriers ask to see training curriculum or content examples

**Recommendation:**
**ENHANCE:** Add separate question or clarification for training content:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Add new question for training content
- **Q7.2:** Maintain current frequency question (TIER 1B)
- **New Q7.4:** "Does security awareness training cover current cybersecurity threats and organization-specific risks (phishing, password security, social engineering, data handling, incident reporting)?"
  - Impact: 3 (content quality matters but frequency is primary driver)
  - Tier: Comprehensive (not universal carrier gate, but best practice)

**Option 2:** Enhance Q7.1 (Security Awareness Program)
- **Q7.1:** "Documented security awareness training program with defined roles, curriculum, and delivery schedule"
- **Emphasis:** "Curriculum" component addresses content quality
- **Assessment Guidance:** Fully Implemented requires curriculum covering critical threat topics
- Preferable because Q7.1 already addresses program documentation

**Option 3:** Add assessment guidance only
- Maintain current questions
- Assessment guidance for Q7.2 specifies: Training must cover critical topics (phishing, passwords, social engineering) to receive Fully Implemented rating
- Less preferable because adds content requirement to frequency question

**Recommended Approach:** Enhance Q7.1 assessment guidance to emphasize curriculum quality, covering critical threat topics. Do not add separate question for 2026.

**Category:** HIGH - Content quality matters but frequency is primary insurance driver

---

#### HIGH-6: Incident Response Plan Testing Specificity (Q9.3)

**Finding:** Q9.3 asks about "IR testing frequency (tabletops)" but carriers increasingly require evidence of testing results and lessons learned.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **The Trust:** Requires incident response plan (testing expected)
- **Insurance Applications:** Many carriers now ask for evidence of tabletop exercises, contact trees, and lessons learned documentation
- **Industry Standard:** Effective IR testing includes post-exercise reviews and plan updates based on findings
- **Coalition:** "Carriers expect organizations to run tabletop that exercises roles, legal steps, and communication, and capture lessons learned to close items"

**Current Question:**
- **Q9.3:** "IR testing frequency (tabletops)" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Evidence:** None currently cited
- **Issue:** Question assesses testing frequency but not testing quality or lessons learned integration

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization running annual tabletop with no follow-up answers "Fully Implemented"
- Organization running annual tabletop with documented lessons learned and plan updates also answers "Fully Implemented"
- No assessment of whether testing leads to actual plan improvements

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers increasingly ask for evidence of testing (not just attestation)
- Screenshots, tabletop scenarios, lessons learned documentation may be requested
- Effective IR testing includes post-exercise reviews and corrective actions
- Organizations that test but don't improve plans have limited value from testing

**Recommendation:**
**ENHANCE:** Revise Q9.3 to address testing quality and lessons learned:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Add lessons learned component
- **Current:** "IR testing frequency (tabletops)"
- **Revised:** "IR testing frequency (tabletops with documented lessons learned and plan updates based on findings)"
- **Assessment Logic:**
  - Fully = Annual tabletop with lessons learned and plan updates
  - Partial = Tabletop conducted but limited documentation or no plan updates
  - Not = No tabletop testing

**Option 2:** Add assessment guidance
- Maintain current question
- Assessment guidance specifies: Fully Implemented requires tabletop with lessons learned documentation and plan updates
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Option 3:** Separate testing from lessons learned
- **Q9.3:** "IR testing frequency (tabletops)" (maintains current question)
- **New Q9.4:** "Are lessons learned from IR testing documented and used to update the incident response plan?"
  - Impact: 3
  - Tier: Comprehensive
- More complex but provides granular assessment

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (revise Q9.3 to include lessons learned component). This aligns with carrier expectations without adding question count.

**Category:** HIGH - Testing quality matters, not just frequency

---

#### HIGH-7: Cloud Security Posture Management Scope (Q4.10)

**Finding:** Q4.10 asks about "Cloud security posture management (CSPM)" but does not clarify scope or applicability for organizations with limited cloud usage.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Cloud Adoption:** 39% of cloud incidents involve credential compromise (IBM 2024)
- **CSPM Tools:** Automatically detect misconfigurations in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Misconfiguration Risk:** 23% of breaches involve misconfigurations (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- **Emerging Requirement:** CSPM is emerging best practice but not universal carrier requirement

**Current Question:**
- **Q4.10:** "Cloud security posture management (CSPM)" - Impact: 5, Comprehensive
- **Evidence:** None currently cited
- **Issue:** Question does not clarify when CSPM applies or provide N/A option for organizations with minimal cloud usage

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- K-12 school district with only Google Workspace (email/docs) unsure if CSPM applies (likely overkill)
- Healthcare organization with Azure cloud infrastructure should have CSPM (appropriate control)
- No guidance on when CSPM is expected vs. when it's beyond organization's scope

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect cloud security controls appropriate to cloud usage scope
- CSPM is appropriate for organizations with IaaS/PaaS cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- CSPM may be overkill for organizations using only SaaS applications (email, document storage)
- Organizations should not be penalized for not having CSPM if they have minimal cloud infrastructure

**Recommendation:**
**CLARIFY:** Revise Q4.10 to specify applicability:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Add scope clarification
- **Current:** "Cloud security posture management (CSPM)"
- **Revised:** "Cloud security posture management (CSPM) - For organizations using cloud infrastructure (IaaS/PaaS such as AWS, Azure, GCP), does organization use CSPM tools to monitor and detect cloud misconfigurations?"
- **Assessment Logic:**
  - Fully = CSPM tools deployed and actively monitoring
  - Partial = Manual cloud security reviews but no automated CSPM
  - Not = No CSPM despite using cloud infrastructure
  - N/A = Organization uses only SaaS applications (email, docs), no IaaS/PaaS infrastructure

**Option 2:** Add assessment guidance
- Maintain current question
- Assessment guidance specifies: CSPM applies to organizations with IaaS/PaaS cloud infrastructure; N/A for SaaS-only environments
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (revise Q4.10 to clarify scope and applicability). This prevents inappropriate penalization of organizations with limited cloud usage.

**Category:** HIGH - Scope clarification needed to avoid inappropriate penalization

---

#### HIGH-8: Web Application Security Applicability (Q4.12)

**Finding:** Q4.12 asks about "Web application security (if applicable)" but does not provide clear N/A handling in grading.

**Current Question:**
- **Q4.12:** "Web application security (if applicable): Security update and vulnerability patching process for web-facing applications" - Impact: 5, Comprehensive
- **Evidence:** None currently cited
- **Issue:** "If applicable" language suggests N/A option, but grading methodology unclear on how N/A responses are handled

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization with no web applications should answer N/A
- Grading model: Does N/A count as "Fully Implemented" (no gap because not applicable) or is it excluded from score calculation?
- Current Grade Ceiling methodology does not explicitly address N/A handling

**Insurance Reality:**
- Organizations with web applications face additional attack surface
- Web application vulnerabilities are common breach vectors
- Organizations without web applications should not be penalized for lacking web application security controls
- Organizations should not receive credit for controls that don't apply to them

**Recommendation:**
**CLARIFY:** Establish explicit N/A handling in grading methodology:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Exclude N/A from score calculation
- Questions marked N/A are excluded from denominator in score calculation
- Organization assessed on actual applicable controls only
- Prevents both inappropriate penalization (for lacking inapplicable control) and inappropriate credit (for answering N/A)

**Option 2:** N/A counts as Fully Implemented
- Rationale: No gap exists because control doesn't apply
- Risk: Organizations without web applications receive credit for control they don't need
- Less preferable because it inflates scores for organizations with smaller attack surface

**Option 3:** N/A counts as Not Implemented
- Rationale: Prevents credit for inapplicable controls
- Risk: Penalizes organizations for not having controls they don't need
- Not recommended

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (exclude N/A from score calculation). Update grading methodology documentation to explicitly address N/A handling for Q4.10 (CSPM), Q4.12 (Web application security), and any future conditional questions.

**Category:** HIGH - Grading methodology clarification needed for conditional questions

---

#### HIGH-9: Logging and SIEM Review Process (Q4.9)

**Finding:** Q4.9 asks about "Centralized logging/SIEM with 90+ day retention and documented review process" but does not assess review effectiveness.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Detection Speed:** Organizations with effective log monitoring detect breaches 54 days faster (IBM 2024)
- **Compliance:** 90-day retention is standard requirement (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, cyber insurance)
- **Review Process:** Documented review process is necessary but not sufficient; reviews must actually identify anomalies
- **SIEM Effectiveness:** Many organizations have SIEM deployed but not properly configured or monitored

**Current Question:**
- **Q4.9:** "Centralized logging/SIEM with 90+ day retention and documented review process" - Impact: 5, Comprehensive
- **Evidence:** None currently cited
- **Issue:** Question assesses logging infrastructure and documented process but not review effectiveness

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization with SIEM, 90-day retention, documented weekly review process (but reviews are checkbox exercise) answers "Fully Implemented"
- Organization with SIEM, 90-day retention, documented review process that actively identifies and responds to anomalies also answers "Fully Implemented"
- No distinction between having documented process vs. having effective process

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect logging and monitoring to enable threat detection
- Documented review process is baseline expectation
- Effective monitoring includes alerting on suspicious activity and investigation of alerts
- Organizations with logging but no effective review have limited detection capability

**Recommendation:**
**ENHANCE:** Revise Q4.9 to address review effectiveness:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Add alerting component
- **Current:** "Centralized logging/SIEM with 90+ day retention and documented review process"
- **Revised:** "Centralized logging/SIEM with 90+ day retention, documented review process, and alerting for security-relevant events"
- **Assessment Logic:**
  - Fully = Logging + retention + review process + alerting configured
  - Partial = Logging + retention + review process but limited alerting
  - Not = No centralized logging or retention <90 days

**Option 2:** Add assessment guidance
- Maintain current question
- Assessment guidance specifies: Fully Implemented requires review process that includes alerting and investigation of security-relevant events
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Option 3:** Separate logging from review effectiveness
- **Q4.9:** "Centralized logging/SIEM with 90+ day retention" (infrastructure)
- **New Q4.9a:** "Are security logs reviewed regularly with alerting configured for security-relevant events?" (review effectiveness)
- More complex but provides granular assessment

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (revise Q4.9 to include alerting component). This ensures logging infrastructure is accompanied by detection capability.

**Category:** HIGH - Review effectiveness matters, not just documented process

---

#### HIGH-10: Password Policy Specificity (Q2.3)

**Finding:** Q2.3 asks about "Password policy (length, complexity, changes)" but lacks specific thresholds aligned with current NIST guidance.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **NIST 800-63B (2024):** Recommends 12-character minimum for user passwords, 15+ for administrative accounts
- **Complexity Requirements:** NIST no longer recommends complexity requirements (special characters, uppercase, etc.) due to user behavior research showing complexity leads to weaker, predictable passwords
- **Password Changes:** NIST no longer recommends mandatory periodic password changes unless compromise suspected
- **Insurance Reality:** Carriers typically require 12+ character passwords (some specify 12-character minimum in applications)

**Current Question:**
- **Q2.3:** "Password policy (length, complexity, changes)" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Evidence:** None currently cited
- **Issue:** Question mentions policy components but does not specify minimum acceptable standards

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization with 8-character password minimum answers based on existence of policy (may answer Fully Implemented)
- Organization with 12-character password minimum also answers Fully Implemented
- No objective threshold for evaluating password policy adequacy

**Insurance Reality:**
- **2025 Carrier Requirement:** "Most cyber insurance policies require 12+ character passwords" (multiple sources from WebSearch)
- **Compliance Standard:** 12-character minimum is widely accepted baseline
- **NIST Guidance:** 12-character minimum for users, 15+ for admins
- Organizations with <12-character minimums may face insurance restrictions

**Recommendation:**
**ENHANCE:** Revise Q2.3 to specify minimum password length:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Specify minimum length threshold
- **Current:** "Password policy (length, complexity, changes)"
- **Revised:** "Password policy requiring minimum 12-character passwords (15+ for administrative accounts preferred)"
- **Assessment Logic:**
  - Fully = 12+ character minimum (15+ for admins)
  - Partial = 10-11 character minimum
  - Not = <10 character minimum or no password policy

**Option 2:** Add assessment guidance
- Maintain current question
- Assessment guidance specifies: Fully Implemented requires 12+ character minimum per NIST 800-63B and carrier requirements
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in question itself

**Option 3:** Remove "complexity" and "changes" per NIST guidance
- **Revised:** "Password policy requiring minimum 12-character passwords"
- Rationale: NIST no longer recommends complexity requirements or mandatory periodic changes
- Aligns with current cybersecurity best practices

**Recommended Approach:** Option 3 (specify minimum length, remove outdated complexity/change requirements). This aligns with NIST 800-63B (2024) guidance and carrier expectations.

**Note:** This change aligns with Q2.11 recommendation (account lockout policies) to comprehensively address credential-based attack prevention.

**Category:** HIGH - Current guidance misaligned with NIST 800-63B and carrier requirements

---

#### HIGH-11: Backup Encryption Verification (Q6.1)

**Finding:** Q6.1 enhancement added "encryption in transit and at rest" requirement but does not provide assessment guidance for verification.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Backup Targeting:** 96% of ransomware attacks target backups (Rubrik 2024)
- **Encryption Requirement:** Unencrypted backups create data exfiltration risk even if immutable
- **Verification Challenge:** Organizations may assume backups are encrypted but not verify
- **Carrier Expectation:** Encryption for backups is increasingly standard requirement

**Current Question:**
- **Q6.1:** "Backup process (existence, frequency, scope of systems/data backed up, encryption in transit and at rest)" - Impact: 5, Comprehensive
- **v6.0 Enhancement:** Added "encryption in transit and at rest" requirement
- **Issue:** Question asks about encryption but does not provide guidance on verification methods

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Organization assumes backup vendor encrypts data but has not verified
- Organization has verified encryption is configured for backups
- Both may answer "Fully Implemented" despite different verification levels

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers expect organizations to verify backup encryption, not just assume it
- Backup vendors typically offer encryption but it must be explicitly configured
- Default configurations may not include encryption
- Verification methods: Vendor documentation, backup software settings review, test restore review

**Recommendation:**
**CLARIFY:** Add assessment guidance for Q6.1 encryption verification:

**Assessment Guidance:**
Organizations should verify backup encryption through one or more of the following:
1. Review backup software configuration settings (encryption enabled)
2. Confirm vendor documentation or SOC 2 report includes encryption specifications
3. Test restore process and verify data is encrypted in backup repository
4. Review backup job logs for encryption confirmation

**Assessment Logic:**
- Fully = Encryption verified for both in-transit and at-rest backup data
- Partial = Encryption configured but not verified, OR encryption for one but not both (transit/rest)
- Not = No encryption configured for backups

**Alternative:** Enhance question wording
- **Current:** "...encryption in transit and at rest"
- **Revised:** "...verified encryption in transit and at rest"
- Less disruptive, adds verification requirement to question itself

**Recommended Approach:** Add assessment guidance (preferred) or enhance question wording. Both approaches ensure organizations verify encryption rather than assume it.

**Category:** HIGH - Verification gap creates risk of false positive assessments

---

#### HIGH-12: Vendor Management Scope (Q8.1-8.3)

**Finding:** Vendor management questions (Q8.1-8.3) do not distinguish between vendors with access to systems/data vs. vendors without access.

**Carrier Evidence:**
- **Third-Party Breaches:** 30% of breaches involve third parties (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- **Supply Chain Risk:** Vendors with access to systems or data create supply chain attack vector
- **Carrier Focus:** Insurance applications typically ask about vendors with "access to systems or data," not all vendors
- **Risk Differentiation:** Vendor selling office supplies has different risk profile than vendor managing IT infrastructure

**Current Questions:**
- **Q8.1:** "Vendor inventory" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Q8.2:** "Security questionnaires/attestations (SOC 2/ISO)" - Impact: 5, Comprehensive
- **Q8.3:** "Contract security requirements" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Issue:** Questions do not clarify which vendors require security assessment vs. all vendors

**Assessment Ambiguity:**
- Should organization assess all vendors (including low-risk vendors with no system access)?
- Or only vendors with access to systems/data (higher risk)?
- Current questions do not provide scope clarity

**Insurance Reality:**
- Carriers focus on vendors with "access to systems or sensitive data"
- Low-risk vendors (office supplies, facility services) typically not assessed for cybersecurity
- High-risk vendors (IT managed services, cloud providers, payroll processors) require security assessment
- Organizations should prioritize security assessments for high-risk vendors

**Recommendation:**
**CLARIFY:** Revise vendor management questions to specify scope:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Add scope clarification to all three questions
- **Q8.1 Revised:** "Vendor inventory (focusing on vendors with access to systems or sensitive data)"
- **Q8.2 Revised:** "Security questionnaires/attestations (SOC 2/ISO) for vendors with access to systems or sensitive data"
- **Q8.3 Revised:** "Contract security requirements for vendors with access to systems or sensitive data"

**Option 2:** Add assessment guidance only
- Maintain current questions
- Assessment guidance specifies: Focus on vendors with access to systems or sensitive data; low-risk vendors without access may be excluded from security assessment
- Less preferable because ambiguity remains in questions themselves

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (revise all three questions to specify "vendors with access to systems or sensitive data"). This aligns with carrier expectations and prevents inappropriate penalization for not assessing low-risk vendors.

**Category:** HIGH - Scope clarification needed to align with carrier focus on high-risk vendors

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY FINDINGS

---

#### MEDIUM-1: Change Management Process Specificity (Q4.8)

**Finding:** Q4.8 asks about "Change management process" but does not specify key components.

**Current Question:**
- **Q4.8:** "Change management process" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Issue:** Generic question without specific guidance on what constitutes adequate change management

**Recommendation:**
Acceptable as-is for Comprehensive tier. Change management practices vary widely by organization size and maturity. Overly prescriptive requirements may not fit all CyberPools member organizations.

**Category:** MEDIUM - Generic question appropriate for maturity assessment

---

#### MEDIUM-2: Physical Security Controls Scope (Q4.11)

**Finding:** Q4.11 asks about "Physical security controls" but does not specify which controls are expected.

**Current Question:**
- **Q4.11:** "Physical security controls" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Issue:** Broad category without specific guidance (locks? cameras? access badges? visitor logs?)

**Recommendation:**
Consider adding examples in assessment guidance:
- Server room access controls (locks, badges)
- Visitor management procedures
- Equipment disposal procedures (secure destruction)
- Acceptable as-is for Comprehensive tier with enhanced guidance

**Category:** MEDIUM - Generic question appropriate with assessment guidance clarification

---

#### MEDIUM-3: Information Security Policies Annual Review (Q10.1)

**Finding:** Q10.1 asks about "Information security policies (documented, deployed, and reviewed at least annually)" but does not assess policy effectiveness or compliance monitoring.

**Current Question:**
- **Q10.1:** "Information security policies (documented, deployed, and reviewed at least annually)" - Impact: 3, Comprehensive
- **Issue:** Policies can be documented and reviewed but not followed or enforced

**Recommendation:**
Acceptable as-is for Comprehensive tier. Policy effectiveness assessment would require additional questions about:
- Compliance monitoring
- Policy violation tracking
- User awareness of policies
- Policy enforcement mechanisms

Adding these dimensions would increase assessment complexity beyond appropriate scope for 2026. Consider for future maturity model development.

**Category:** MEDIUM - Current scope appropriate, future enhancement opportunity

---

## Sector-Specific Analysis

### K-12 Education Sector (Primary CyberPools Membership)

**Assessment Alignment: STRONG**

The 2026 RA v6.0 is well-aligned with K-12 education sector needs:

**Strengths:**
1. FERPA Alignment: Data protection questions (Category 3) address student data protection requirements
2. Limited Budget Appropriateness: TIER 1A controls are achievable for K-12 budgets (MFA, EDR, backups)
3. Student Safety Focus: Phishing testing and security awareness appropriate for K-12 environment

**Gaps:**
1. **CIPA Compliance:** Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires internet safety policies and technology protection measures. Assessment does not explicitly address CIPA requirements.
2. **Student Device Management:** Many K-12 districts manage Chromebooks/iPads for students. Assessment focuses on enterprise endpoints but does not distinguish student devices.
3. **Third-Party EdTech Vendors:** K-12 organizations use extensive third-party education technology platforms. Vendor management questions (Q8.1-8.3) should emphasize EdTech vendor security.

**Recommendation:**
Add K-12 sector guidance to assessment documentation:
- CIPA compliance mapping (Q5.2 web filtering, Q10.1 policies)
- Student device security guidance (Q4.3 secure configuration, Q3.7 encryption may not apply to managed Chromebooks)
- EdTech vendor assessment focus (Q8.1-8.3)

**Insurance Implications:**
K-12 cyber insurance market is tightening. 82% of K-12 districts have cyber insurance or plan to acquire it. The assessment accurately reflects K-12 insurance requirements.

---

### Healthcare Sector (Vitalant Expansion)

**Assessment Alignment: STRONG with CRITICAL GAPS**

The 2026 RA v6.0 has gaps for healthcare/HIPAA organizations:

**Strengths:**
1. HIPAA Baseline Coverage: MFA, encryption, access controls, backups align with HIPAA Security Rule
2. Breach Prevention Focus: Controls prevent breaches that trigger HIPAA breach notification (major cost driver)
3. Incident Response: Q9.1 incident response plan aligns with HIPAA breach response requirements

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Endpoint Encryption (CRITICAL-3):** Q3.7 classified as TIER 1B but should be TIER 1A for HIPAA organizations (lost device = breach notification)
2. **Business Associate Agreements:** Assessment does not address BAA requirements with vendors handling PHI (distinct from general vendor security Q8.2-8.3)
3. **HIPAA Risk Analysis:** HIPAA requires annual risk analysis; assessment does not explicitly address this requirement
4. **Encryption of PHI at Rest:** Q3.2 addresses data encryption but should explicitly mention PHI for healthcare organizations
5. **Audit Controls:** HIPAA requires audit logs for PHI access; Q4.9 logging question should emphasize PHI access logging for healthcare

**Recommendation:**
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Create healthcare/HIPAA sector variant:
1. Reclassify Q3.7 (Endpoint encryption) as TIER 1A for healthcare sector (CRITICAL-3 finding)
2. Enhance Q8.3 (Contract security requirements) to explicitly address Business Associate Agreements for healthcare
3. Add healthcare sector guidance for Q3.2 (data encryption) emphasizing PHI encryption requirements
4. Add healthcare sector guidance for Q4.9 (logging) emphasizing PHI access logging

**Insurance Implications:**
Healthcare cyber insurance has additional requirements:
- HIPAA compliance is pre-requisite for coverage
- Lost device without encryption = claim denial risk (breach notification costs not covered)
- Missing BAAs with vendors = HIPAA violation that may void coverage

**Assessment must distinguish healthcare organizations and apply appropriate TIER classifications.**

---

### Religious Organizations (Christian Brothers Services)

**Assessment Alignment: STRONG**

The 2026 RA v6.0 is appropriate for religious organizations:

**Strengths:**
1. Budget-Appropriate Controls: TIER 1A controls achievable for smaller religious organizations
2. Donor Data Protection: Data protection questions (Category 3) address donor/member data sensitivity
3. Limited IT Staff: Assessment does not assume large IT teams; controls scalable to organization size

**Considerations:**
1. **Small Organization Scalability:** Some Comprehensive questions (Q4.10 CSPM, Q8.2 Vendor SOC 2) may be beyond scope for small religious organizations
2. **Volunteer IT Support:** Many religious organizations rely on volunteer IT support; assessment should acknowledge this in guidance
3. **Cloud-First Environment:** Many religious organizations use cloud-only infrastructure (no on-premises servers); assessment should acknowledge this in guidance

**Recommendation:**
Add religious organization sector guidance:
- Small organization scalability notes (Q4.10 CSPM may be N/A for cloud-only orgs)
- Volunteer IT support acknowledgment (controls must be achievable without full-time IT staff)
- Cloud-first environment guidance (some questions may not apply to organizations without on-premises infrastructure)

**Insurance Implications:**
Religious organizations face similar cyber risks as K-12 and healthcare but with smaller budgets. Assessment appropriately balances insurance requirements with achievability.

## Grade Ceiling Methodology Insurance Alignment

### Analysis: Does Grade Ceiling Accurately Predict Insurance Outcomes?

**Methodology Review:**
The Grade Ceiling methodology applies maximum grades based on critical control gaps:
- Missing 2+ TIER 1A controls → Grade F
- Missing 1 TIER 1A control → Grade C
- Missing 1+ TIER 1B controls → Grade B
- No critical gaps → No ceiling (score-based grade)

**Insurance Reality Mapping:**

| Grade | Missing Controls | Grade Ceiling Prediction | Actual Insurance Outcome | Alignment |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| F | 2+ TIER 1A | "Uninsurable" | Coverage denial or severe restrictions from 95%+ carriers | ACCURATE |
| D | N/A (score-based) | "High risk, major gaps" | Restricted coverage, high premiums | ACCURATE |
| C | 1 TIER 1A | "Developing with critical gap" | Restrictions or sub-limits from majority of carriers | ACCURATE |
| B | 1+ TIER 1B | "Proficient with foundational gap" | Rate optimization impact, possible preferred terms denied | PARTIALLY ACCURATE |
| A | No TIER gaps | "Advanced, insurance-preferred" | Preferred terms, competitive rates | ACCURATE |

**Verdict: STRONG ALIGNMENT with TIER 1A, PARTIAL ALIGNMENT with TIER 1B**

**Evidence:**

**Grade F Prediction (Missing 2+ TIER 1A):**
- **Example:** Organization missing MFA for remote access AND EDR deployment
- **Grade Ceiling:** Grade F (49% score example from grading doc)
- **Insurance Reality:** Uninsurable from major carriers (Coalition, Travelers, Chubb all require both controls)
- **Hamilton City Case:** $5M claim denied for missing MFA, total $18.4M recovery costs
- **Assessment:** ACCURATE - Grade F signals actual uninsurability

**Grade C Prediction (Missing 1 TIER 1A):**
- **Example:** Organization missing MFA for remote access (Q2.3) but has all other TIER 1A controls
- **Grade Ceiling:** Grade C (93% score example from grading doc)
- **Insurance Reality:**
  - Coverage restrictions or sub-limits from majority of carriers (95%+ require MFA)
  - Hamilton City case demonstrates claim denial risk
  - May obtain restricted coverage from some carriers willing to accept higher risk
- **Assessment:** ACCURATE - Grade C signals material insurance restrictions

**Grade B Prediction (Missing 1+ TIER 1B):**
- **Example:** Organization missing network segmentation (Q4.6, should be TIER 1B per CRITICAL-2)
- **Grade Ceiling:** Grade B (if Q4.6 reclassified to TIER 1B)
- **Insurance Reality:**
  - 70% of carriers require network segmentation
  - Premium surcharge of 15-25% likely
  - Preferred coverage terms denied
  - Not coverage-blocking (can still obtain insurance) but affects pricing/terms
- **Assessment:** PARTIALLY ACCURATE - Grade B signals restrictions, but severity depends on which TIER 1B control is missing

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**

**Not all TIER 1B gaps have equal insurance impact:**

| Missing TIER 1B Control | Carrier Prevalence | Insurance Impact | Current Grade | Appropriate Grade |
|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Q3.5 PAM | 42% required | Premium surcharge likely | B | Should be A- or C |
| Q4.13 Network firmware | CIS IG1, assessed by carriers | Moderate impact | B | Appropriate |
| Q5.4 Email auth (DMARC) | Standard application question | Premium surcharge likely | B | Should be A- or C |
| Q7.2 Training frequency | Standard requirement | Moderate impact | B | Appropriate |
| Q7.3 Phishing testing | Standard requirement | Moderate impact | B | Appropriate |
| Q9.1 IR plan documented | Universal expectation | Moderate impact | B | Appropriate |

**Finding:** Missing Q3.5 (PAM, 42% required) should have greater grade impact than missing Q4.13 (Network firmware). Current Grade Ceiling methodology treats all TIER 1B gaps equally.

**Recommendation:**

**Option 1:** Reclassify high-impact TIER 1B controls to TIER 1A
- Move Q3.5 (PAM) to TIER 1A (per CRITICAL-1)
- Move Q4.6 (Network segmentation) to TIER 1B (per CRITICAL-2)
- Maintains binary ceiling logic (TIER 1A = Grade C, TIER 1B = Grade B)

**Option 2:** Create TIER 1B sub-tiers
- TIER 1B-High: Missing → Grade C (same impact as missing 1 TIER 1A)
- TIER 1B-Standard: Missing → Grade B (current logic)
- Controls: Q3.5 PAM and Q5.4 Email Auth = TIER 1B-High based on carrier prevalence/impact
- More complex but provides granularity

**Option 3:** Accept limitation, document in guidance
- Acknowledge that TIER 1B ceiling (Grade B) represents "range of insurance impacts from moderate to significant"
- Document which TIER 1B controls have higher insurance impact in assessment guidance
- Simplest approach but less precise

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (reclassify high-impact controls). This maintains Grade Ceiling simplicity while improving prediction accuracy.

2. Add Q2.11 (Account lockout), Q4.15 (Secure RDP), Q4.16 (Internal scanning)
3. Revise Q7.3 to specify phishing frequency
4. Implement sector-specific TIER classification for Q3.7 (Healthcare endpoint encryption)
5. Establish N/A handling in grading methodology
6. Update question count: 53 → 56 questions (3 new questions)
7. Update TIER distribution: TIER 1A (9 → 10), TIER 1B (9 → 10), Comprehensive (35 → 36)

**Impact:** Ensures assessment accurately reflects 2025 insurance market requirements before launch.

### Phase 2: 2026 Assessment Cycle (HIGH Priority Enhancements)

**Can be implemented during 2026 cycle or for 2027:**

1. Revise Q6.3, Q5.3, Q9.3, Q4.9, Q2.3 per HIGH priority findings
2. Add assessment guidance for Q7.1, Q6.1, Q4.10, Q8.1-8.3
3. Create sector-specific guidance documents (K-12, Healthcare, Religious)
4. Monitor Q5.4 (Email auth) and MFA phishing-resistant trends for 2027 updates

**Impact:** Improves assessment precision and sector applicability.

### Phase 3: 2027 Planning (Future Enhancements)

**Strategic planning for 2027-2028 assessment cycles:**

1. Re-evaluate Q5.4 (Email auth) for TIER 1A reclassification based on 2026 market data
2. Consider phishing-resistant MFA differentiation (standard vs. premium tier)
3. Evaluate policy effectiveness assessment expansion (Q10.1 enhancement)
4. Review emerging carrier requirements (AI/ML security, software supply chain, etc.)

**Impact:** Maintains assessment alignment with evolving insurance market.
