# Archive - POC Research Documents

**Archive Date:** November 3, 2025
**Reason:** Clean separation of current work from historical iterations and exploratory research

---

## Archive Structure

### `/grading-iterations/` (11 documents)

Superseded grading methodology documents from Nov 1-2, 2025. These were iterations leading to the final **Grade Ceiling** model:

- `FINAL_GRADING_SYSTEM_RECOMMENDATION.md` (Nov 2) - Early Grade Ceiling iteration
- `2026_COMPREHENSIVE_GRADING_METHODOLOGY.md` (Nov 2) - Progressive gating approach
- `2026_GRADING_METHODOLOGY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (Nov 2) - Progressive gating exec summary
- `GRADING_SYSTEM_GRC_INSURANCE_VALIDATION.md` (Nov 2) - Early validation work
- `2026_GRADING_SYSTEM_COMPREHENSIVE_RECOMMENDATION.md` (Nov 1) - Earlier comprehensive doc
- `INSURANCE_GRC_VALIDATION_2026_GRADING.md` (Nov 1) - Earlier validation
- `GRADING_MODELS_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (Nov 1) - Earlier exec summary
- `GRADING_MODELS_VISUAL_COMPARISON.md` (Nov 2) - Visual comparison work
- `FOUR_TIER_REAL_EXAMPLES.md` (Nov 1) - Examples (content integrated into current docs)
- `HYBRID_PASSFAIL_WITH_SCORE.md` (Nov 2) - Hybrid approach exploration
- `IMPACT_RATING_REVIEW_ANALYSIS.md` (Nov 1) - Impact rating analysis (completed)

**Status:** Superseded by current Grade Ceiling implementation documents
**Value:** Historical record of methodology evolution

Early POC and exploratory work from Oct 27, 2024:

- `ACTUAL_GRADING_OPTIONS.md` (Oct 30) - Early grading options exploration
- `GRADING_MODEL_APPROACHES.md` (Oct 30) - Early approach documentation
- `80_20_MODEL_FINAL_RESULTS.md` (Oct 27) - 80/20 model simulation
- `GRADING_SIMULATION_RESULTS.md` (Oct 27) - Simulation results
- `TIER_MODEL_FINAL_SUMMARY.md` (Oct 27) - Tier model summary
- `ASSESSMENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` (Oct 27) - Gap analysis
- `POC_TEAM_PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md` (Oct 27) - Presentation guide
- `POC_VISUAL_ENHANCEMENTS.md` (Oct 27) - Visual design work
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (Oct 27) - Quick reference guide
- `Tier I Req Table.png` (Oct 27) - Visual asset

**Status:** Exploratory work that informed later decisions
**Value:** Shows evolution of thinking, useful for understanding why certain approaches were chosen

---

### `/other-topics/` (9 documents)

Documents covering topics beyond grading methodology from Oct 30, 2024:

- `AI_QUESTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - AI/ML questions research for assessment expansion
- `ASSESSMENT_EXPANSION_RESEARCH.md` - Expanding assessment to other sectors
- `CEO_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF_2026_ASSESSMENT_STRATEGY.md` - Strategy brief
- `CITATION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` - Citation validation work
- `COMPREHENSIVE_RA_DOCUMENT_STATUS.md` - Document status tracking
- `CyberPools Company Profile.md` - Company background
- `DUAL_SCORE_ASSESSMENT_STRUCTURE.md` - Early dual-score concept
- `INSURANCE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Strategic assessment
- `SECTOR_NEUTRAL_ASSESSMENT_EXPANSION.md` - Sector expansion research

**Status:** Completed research on adjacent topics
**Value:** May be relevant for future expansion work (AI questions, sector expansion)

## Why These Were Archived

### Grading Iterations
- Multiple documents explored different grading approaches (flat, true gating, progressive gating, grade ceiling)
- Final decision: **Grade Ceiling** (unanimous expert recommendation)
- Earlier iterations superseded by comprehensive comparison documents
- Content consolidated into final implementation guide

### Exploratory POC
- Early proof-of-concept work from late October
- Helped establish foundational concepts and terminology
- Informed final methodology design
- No longer needed for current implementation

### Other Topics
- Covered important but separate topics (AI questions, sector expansion)
- Not directly related to current grading methodology implementation
- Can be retrieved if those topics become active again

## How to Use This Archive

**If you need to:**

1. **Understand why Grade Ceiling was chosen** → See current docs (GRADING_METHODOLOGY_COMPARISON_*.md)
2. **See the evolution of thinking** → Review `/exploratory-poc/` documents chronologically
3. **Review earlier grading iterations** → Check `/grading-iterations/` for specific approaches
4. **Research AI questions or expansion** → Check `/other-topics/` for that specific research

**Important:** All superseded content is preserved here. Nothing was deleted, only organized for clarity.
