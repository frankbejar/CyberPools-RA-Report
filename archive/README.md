# Archive - Historical Content

**Status:** Reference only - Not for active development

This folder contains historical research, proof-of-concept work, and alternative methodologies explored during the development of the 2026 Risk Assessment.

## Contents

### poc-research/

**What it contains:**
- Alternative grading model POCs (dual-score, weighted scoring)
- Insurance alignment research and analysis (including v6.0 review from Nov 17, 2025)
- True Gating methodology analysis
- Grade Ceiling implementation research
- Insurance eligibility research and executive summaries

**Purpose:**
Historical reference showing the research and analysis that informed the final Grade Ceiling methodology selected for 2026 RA v6.2 FINAL.

**Key Documents:**
- `2026_RA_v6.0_INSURANCE_ALIGNMENT_REVIEW.md` - Insurance alignment review (based on older v6.0)
- `GRADE_CEILING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation research
- `TRUE_GATING_METHODOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of True Gating approach
- `INSURANCE_ELIGIBILITY_RESEARCH.md` - Insurance market research

## Important Notes

**DO NOT reference for current work:**
- Documents in this folder may be based on older versions (v5.0, v6.0)
- Research findings have been incorporated into production documents in `2026 RA/`
- POC concepts were explored but not all were adopted

**For current 2026 RA work:**
Use documents in `../2026 RA/` - these are the production-ready, finalized versions:
- `2026_RA_QUESTION_SET_v6.2_FINAL.md`
- `2026_RA_TIER_FRAMEWORK_JUSTIFICATION.md`
- `GRADING_METHODOLOGY_EXECUTIVE_R2.md`
- `GRADING_METHODOLOGY_TECHNICAL_SUPPLEMENT.md`

## Why Keep This?

This archive demonstrates:
1. **Research rigor** - Multiple methodologies were evaluated with evidence
2. **Decision traceability** - Shows why Grade Ceiling was selected
3. **Historical context** - Documents the evolution from flat scoring to current approach
4. **Academic validation** - Research suitable for peer review and stakeholder scrutiny

## Maintenance

**Do not delete** - Historical value for:
- Explaining methodology decisions to stakeholders
- Academic/research purposes
- Insurance carrier validation discussions
- Future methodology updates (lessons learned)

**Do not update** - Frozen as historical snapshot
