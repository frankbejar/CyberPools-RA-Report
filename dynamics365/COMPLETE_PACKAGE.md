## 🎯 What It Does

Generates professional PDF reports directly from Dynamics 365:

1. User clicks button on Risk Assessment form
2. JavaScript reads assessment data + member info
3. Transforms data (same logic as Python)
4. Generates HTML with your branding
5. Calls DocRaptor API
6. PDF downloads to browser

**No server needed!** Everything runs in the browser.

```

### Modify Button Text

In button HTML (Step 4 of deployment):
```html
<button>📄 Your Custom Text Here</button>
```

### Add Custom Fields to PDF

1. Add field to CONFIG.FIELD_NAMES
2. Read in `getRiskAssessmentData()` function
3. Add to `transformData()` metadata
4. Display in `generateCoverPage()` or other page

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **API Key Visible:** In JavaScript source (Web Resource)
   - Anyone with Web Resource access can see it
   - Mitigation: Restrict Web Resource permissions

2. **Client-Side Processing:** All logic runs in browser
   - Pro: Fast, no server needed
   - Con: Can't hide sensitive logic

3. **DocRaptor Quota:** Shared across all users
   - Monitor usage in dashboard
   - Set alerts for high usage

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **Access Control:**
   - Only grant Web Resource read to necessary roles
   - Monitor who can access assessment data

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Check DocRaptor dashboard weekly
   - Watch for unusual API usage patterns

3. **Key Rotation:**
   - Change API key quarterly
   - Update JavaScript Web Resource after rotation

4. **Future Enhancement:**
   - Migrate to Azure Function for production
   - Keep API key server-side
   - Same user experience, better security

---

## 🚀 Migration Path

### Phase 1: JavaScript POC (Current - Today!)
✅ Deploy in 15 minutes
✅ Test with users
✅ Validate concept
✅ Low cost

### Phase 2: Azure Function (Optional - If High Volume)
- Deploy your Python code to Azure
- JavaScript calls Azure instead of DocRaptor directly
- API key hidden server-side
- Better for >100 reports/month

### Phase 3: Full Server (Optional - If Needed)
- Deploy to RackNerd Linux server
- Full control, no usage limits
- Integrate with other services
- Best for enterprise deployment

**You can stay on Phase 1 indefinitely if it meets your needs!**

## 📈 Success Metrics

After deployment, measure:

### User Adoption
- How many reports generated per week?
- User feedback on ease of use
- Time saved vs manual report creation

### Technical Performance
- PDF generation success rate
- Average generation time
- DocRaptor API errors (if any)

### Cost Effectiveness
- Monthly DocRaptor costs
- Cost per report
- Compare to alternatives

### Quality
- PDF formatting accuracy
- Executive summary usage
- User satisfaction with output
