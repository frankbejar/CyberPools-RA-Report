# Two-Tier Assessment Model - Final Implementation

## Executive Summary

The **Two-Tier Assessment Model** provides a simplified, clean scoring approach that emphasizes foundation compliance while measuring comprehensive security maturity:

- **Tier I Score**: Foundation compliance (12 core questions)
- **Tier II Score**: Comprehensive maturity (80% Tier I + 20% all controls)

**No status badges. No letter grades. Just two clear percentage scores.**

## Final Simulation Results

| Member | Tier I Score | Tier II Score | Impact vs Old Model |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **CBS** | 95% | 95% | -1% (minimal change) |
| **Santa Catalina** | 86% | 85% | **+3%** (rewarded for strong foundation) |
| **Rosary College Prep** | 79% | 79% | **-1%** (foundation gap impact) |
| **Salesian College Prep** | 67% | 69% | **-8%** (major foundation weakness exposed) |

### Key Insights

**High Impact Examples:**
1. **Salesian** - Tier I: 67%, Tier II: 69%
   - Their low foundation score (67%) dramatically pulls down Tier II
   - Old model: 77% → New model: 69% (-8%)
   - Clear signal: foundation gaps are critical

2. **Santa Catalina** - Tier I: 86%, Tier II: 85%
   - Strong foundation (86%) improves their Tier II score
   - Old model: 82% → New model: 85% (+3%)
   - Demonstrates fairness: strong foundation is rewarded

## Model Details

### Tier I Score (Foundation Compliance)
**Based on**: 12 risk assessment questions
**Maps to**: 7 core cyber insurance requirements
**Purpose**: Measures baseline security controls required for cyber insurance eligibility

**The 12 Questions:**
1. 1.4 - EOL software retirement
2. 2.3 - MFA for cloud resources
3. 2.4 - MFA for remote access
4. 2.5 - MFA for admin accounts
5. 2.6 - MFA for critical systems
6. 4.3 - Patch management
7. 4.7 - External vulnerability scans
8. 5.4 - EDR implementation
9. 6.3 - Air gap/immutable backups
10. 6.4 - Backup testing
11. 7.2 - Phishing simulation testing
12. 7.3 - Follow-up security training

### Tier II Score (Comprehensive Maturity)
**Formula**: Tier II = (80% × Tier I) + (20% × Comprehensive)

**Components:**
- 80% from Tier I Score (foundation emphasis)
- 20% from all 51 questions across 9 categories

**Purpose**: Measures overall security maturity while heavily emphasizing foundation compliance

---

## Scoring Thresholds (Informal Guide)

While we don't use official status labels, these thresholds provide context:

**Tier I or Tier II:**
- **85%+**: Strong - meets cyber insurance requirements
- **70-84%**: Adequate - has foundation but room for improvement
- **Below 70%**: Critical gaps - requires immediate attention

## Business Value

### Clear Differentiation
The two-tier model creates natural service/pricing tiers:

**Tier I Performance:**
- 85%+ → Premium members (foundation certified)
- 70-84% → Standard members (foundation developing)
- <70% → Provisional members (foundation critical)

**Tier II Performance:**
- 85%+ → Mature security program
- 70-84% → Adequate security posture
- <70% → Significant security gaps

### Member Communication

**For High Performers (CBS):**
"Your Tier I Score of 95% and Tier II Score of 95% demonstrate exceptional security posture across both foundation controls and comprehensive security practices."

**For Strong Foundation (Santa Catalina):**
"Your Tier I Score of 86% reflects strong foundation compliance. Your Tier II Score of 85% shows how this solid foundation contributes to your overall security maturity."

**For Foundation Gaps (Rosary):**
"Your Tier I Score of 79% is just below the strong compliance threshold (85%). Addressing these foundation gaps will improve both your foundation compliance and your Tier II Score of 79%."

**For Critical Issues (Salesian):**
"Your Tier I Score of 67% indicates critical gaps in foundation controls required for cyber insurance. These gaps significantly impact your Tier II Score of 69%. We recommend immediate remediation of foundation requirements, particularly EDR implementation."

## Technical Implementation

### Calculation Details

```python
# Tier I Score
tier_1_score = calculate_score(foundation_questions)  # 12 questions only

# Comprehensive Score
comprehensive_score = calculate_score(all_questions)  # All 51 questions

# Tier II Score
tier_2_score = (tier_1_score * 0.8) + (comprehensive_score * 0.2)
```

## Team Presentation Talking Points

### 1. Simplicity
"We've simplified from letter grades and status badges to just two clear scores: Tier I (foundation) and Tier II (comprehensive maturity)."

### 2. Foundation Emphasis
"Tier II heavily weights foundation compliance at 80%. Organizations with weak foundations like Salesian (67% Tier I) see this reflected in their Tier II score (69%)."

### 3. Fairness
"Santa Catalina's Tier I score of 86% actually improves their Tier II score from 82% to 85%. Strong foundation work is rewarded."

### 4. Clear Action Items
"When an organization sees Tier I: 67%, they immediately know their foundation needs work. No confusion about what 'Below Foundation' means - just a clear percentage."

### 5. Alignment with Industry
"The two-tier approach aligns with frameworks like CIS Implementation Groups (IG1/IG2), where basic controls are foundational and advanced controls build upon them."

## Advantages of Tier I/Tier II Model

### Over Previous "Foundation Status + Grade" Model:
1. ✅ Simpler to explain and understand
2. ✅ No subjective interpretation of status labels
3. ✅ Clear numerical targets (aim for 85%+)
4. ✅ Easier international communication (no cultural grade interpretation)
5. ✅ More professional/mature presentation

### Over Old Equal-Weight Model:
1. ✅ Foundation gaps have substantial impact (80% weight)
2. ✅ Aligns with cyber insurance priorities
3. ✅ Creates clear differentiation between members
4. ✅ Rewards foundation investment

---

## Recommendation

**Implement the Two-Tier Model (80/20 weighting)** with simplified Tier I/Tier II score display for production use.

### Why This Works:
- Clean, professional presentation
- No confusion about status labels or grade meanings
- Foundation emphasis is mathematically enforced (80%)
- Two clear numbers tell the whole story
- Aligns with CIS IG1/IG2 industry approach

### Next Steps:
1. Present POC reports to team for final approval
2. Update production templates and scripts
3. Prepare member communication about the new model
4. Launch with next assessment cycle

## Appendix: Side-by-Side Comparison

### Old Model Display:
```
Overall Security Score: 82%
Grade: B
```

### Intermediate Model Display (Rejected):
```
Foundation Status: CERTIFIED (86%)
Security Maturity: 85% (Grade B)
```

### Final Two-Tier Model Display (Approved):
```
Tier I Score: 86%
Tier II Score: 85%
```

**Winner**: Clean, simple, professional. Two numbers. No confusion.

- ✅ **Aggressive foundation emphasis** (80% weighting)
- ✅ **Clean presentation** (no status badges or grades)
- ✅ **Clear differentiation** (members see exact scores)
- ✅ **Professional appearance** (aligns with industry standards)
