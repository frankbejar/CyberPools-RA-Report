## Key Findings to Highlight for Team

**Insurance Market Pressure (2025-2026):**
1. **PAM required by 42% of orgs** for cyber insurance (up from 36% in 2023)
2. **82% of claims** involved organizations lacking MFA
3. **SIEM/centralized logging** now required for larger organizations (>500 users)
4. **Email authentication** (DMARC/SPF/DKIM) explicitly listed by Coalition
5. **AI governance** emerging (Coalition offers "Affirmative AI Insurance")

**Threat Landscape (2024-2025):**
1. **88% of breaches** involve stolen credentials â†’ PAM, MFA critical
2. **75% of breaches** include ransomware â†’ backups, EDR, detection critical
3. **67.4% of phishing** now uses AI â†’ email authentication, AI policies needed
4. **Third-party breaches doubled** â†’ vendor certifications, monitoring needed
5. **Average 212 days to detect** breaches â†’ SIEM, detection metrics needed

**Framework Alignment:**
- All questions map to NIST CSF 2.0, CIS Controls v8
- AI questions align with NIST AI RMF
- Sector-specific compliance (FERPA, HIPAA, state privacy laws) addressed in context
- Universal CIA principles emphasized throughout
