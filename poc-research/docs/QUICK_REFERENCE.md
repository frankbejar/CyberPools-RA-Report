# Two-Tier Model - Quick Reference

## Final Simulation Results

| Member | Tier I | Tier II | Old Score | Change | Key Insight |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **CBS** | 95% | 95% | 96% | -1% | Maintains excellence |
| **Santa Catalina** | 86% | 85% | 82% | **+3%** | Strong foundation rewarded ✓ |
| **Rosary College Prep** | 79% | 79% | 80% | -1% | Foundation gap at 79% |
| **Salesian College Prep** | 67% | 69% | 77% | **-8%** | Critical foundation weakness |

## What Each Score Means

**Tier I Score** = Foundation compliance (12 core questions)
- Measures: Baseline cyber insurance requirements
- Target: 85%+ for strong compliance

**Tier II Score** = Comprehensive maturity (80% Tier I + 20% all controls)
- Measures: Overall security posture with heavy foundation emphasis
- Target: 85%+ for strong maturity

## Key Messages

✅ **Simplicity**: Just two percentage scores - no grades, no status badges
✅ **Impact**: 80/20 weighting means foundation is 80% of Tier II score
✅ **Fairness**: Strong foundation pulls score UP (Santa Catalina +3%)
✅ **Accountability**: Weak foundation pulls score DOWN (Salesian -8%)
