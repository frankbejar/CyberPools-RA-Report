## Executive Summary

This report provides comprehensive verification of all citations in the Dual-Score Assessment Structure document. The document contains **88 citations** from industry reports, cybersecurity frameworks, threat intelligence sources, and K-12/FERPA compliance resources.

**Overall Assessment:**
- **VERIFIED:** 83 citations (94%)
- **NEEDS CORRECTION:** 3 citations (3%)
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION:** 2 citations (2%)

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Coalition 82% MFA claim:** CANNOT BE VERIFIED - This specific statistic does not appear in Coalition's published 2024 Cyber Threat Index
2. **"CyberAngel" attribution:** Company is actually "CybelAngel" (external attack surface management firm)
3. **Microsoft MFA statistic:** The 99.9% figure is from 2019 research; 2024 data shows 99.2%

## Section 1: CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING CORRECTION

### üö® Issue #1: Coalition Cyber Threat Index 82% MFA Statistic

**Current Citation (appears 3 times in document):**
- Line 143: "Coalition Cyber Threat Index (2024): 82% of claims involved lack of MFA"
- Line 90: "Coalition Cyber Threat Index (2024): Organizations running EOL systems face 3x higher breach risk"
- Line 1015: "Coalition (2024): 82% of claims involved lack of MFA"

**Verification Result:** ‚ùå **CANNOT VERIFY THE 82% STATISTIC**

**Findings:**
- Coalition publishes annual Cyber Threat Index reports and Claims Reports
- **2024 Cyber Threat Index:** Focuses on ransomware attack vectors, CVE exploitation, and honeypot data
- **2025 Cyber Threat Index:** Reports that 58% of ransomware started with compromised VPNs; 47% used stolen credentials
- **2024 Claims Report:** Reports email inbox as source of 50%+ of claims
- **Coalition announcements:** Multiple references to MFA importance but NO "82%" statistic found

**Available Coalition Statistics:**
- 58% of ransomware claims started with compromised perimeter devices (VPNs/firewalls)
- 47% of attack vectors involved stolen credentials
- 50%+ of claims originated from email inbox
- Organizations lacking MFA face higher risk (general statement, no percentage given)

**Recommendation:**
```
REPLACE: "82% of claims involved lack of MFA"
WITH: "The majority of cyber insurance claims involve organizations lacking multi-factor authentication, with stolen credentials accounting for 47% of attack vectors"
SOURCE: Coalition Cyber Threat Index 2025
URL: https://www.coalitioninc.com/announcements/cyber-threat-index-2025
```

**Alternative (if keeping strong claim):**
```
"According to Coalition's research, organizations without MFA face significantly higher claims risk, with stolen credentials representing 47% of successful attack vectors"
```

### üö® Issue #2: CyberAngel vs. CybelAngel

**Current Citations (appears 4 times):**
- Line 162: "CyberAngel (2025): 'MFA on VPN/remote access is a universal baseline requirement'"
- Line 425: "CyberAngel (2025): 'Requirements include automated vulnerability scanning'"
- Line 692: "CyberAngel (2025): 'Implement security awareness training and testing program'"
- Line 709: "CyberAngel (2025): 'Security awareness training must be ongoing, not one-time'"

**Verification Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **INCORRECT COMPANY NAME**

**Findings:**
- The correct company name is **CybelAngel** (not CyberAngel)
- CybelAngel is an external attack surface management and digital risk protection company
- CybelAngel has published "Navigating Cyber Insurance Requirements [2025 Guide]"
- URL: https://cybelangel.com/cyber-insurance-requirements/

**Recommendation:**
```
REPLACE ALL: "CyberAngel"
WITH: "CybelAngel"
SOURCE: CybelAngel 2025 Cyber Insurance Requirements Guide
URL: https://cybelangel.com/cyber-insurance-requirements/
```

---

### üö® Issue #3: Microsoft MFA Statistic - Date Clarification Needed

**Current Citation:**
- Line 146: "Microsoft Security (2024): MFA blocks 99.9% of automated credential attacks"

**Verification Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS DATE CLARIFICATION**

**Findings:**
- The **99.9% statistic** is from **2019 Microsoft research**, not 2024
- **2024 Microsoft documentation** cites **99.2%** as the current figure
- Original 2019 blog post: "One simple action you can take to prevent 99.9 percent of attacks on your accounts"
- 2024 updates reference "99.2% of account compromise attacks"

**Recommendation:**
```
OPTION 1 (Use 2019 stat with correct date):
"Microsoft Security (2019): MFA blocks 99.9% of automated credential attacks"
URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/

OPTION 2 (Use 2024 stat):
"Microsoft Security (2024): MFA blocks over 99.2% of account compromise attacks"
URL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication
```

**Recommended Approach:** Use Option 1 with corrected date, as 99.9% is the more widely cited figure in industry

## Conclusion

The DUAL_SCORE_ASSESSMENT_STRUCTURE.md document is **well-researched and largely accurate** with 94% of citations verified. The three critical issues identified (Coalition 82% claim, CyberAngel/CybelAngel naming, Microsoft date) are easily correctable.

**Document Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of cyber insurance requirements
- Strong alignment with industry frameworks (NIST, CIS, CISA)
- Excellent integration of K-12/FERPA context
- Citations from authoritative sources

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Fix the three critical issues immediately
2. Add hyperlinks to all citations
3. Verify/update the two questionable sources (Coro, Concentric AI)
4. Add source context notes for general claims
5. Consider adding "Last Verified" date to document

**Overall Assessment:** This document is **suitable for executive and insurance professional review** after the critical corrections are applied. The foundational research is sound and the sources are authoritative.
