# Grading Simulation Results: Old vs New Methodology

## Executive Summary

We simulated the new 60/40 weighted grading model across all 4 CBS member organizations to demonstrate the impact of emphasizing foundation cyber insurance requirements.

### Key Changes
- **Old Method**: Equal weight to all 51 assessment questions
- **New Method**: 60% Foundation (12 questions) + 40% Comprehensive (51 questions)

### Impact Summary
- **Total Members**: 4
- **Grade Changes**: 1 organization (25%)
- **Average Score Change**: -1.5%

## Detailed Results

### 1. CBS
**Status**: ✅ No Grade Change
- **Old Score**: 96% (A)
- **New Score**: 95% (A)
- **Foundation**: 95% - Excellent
- **Comprehensive**: 96% - Excellent
- **Change**: -1%

**Analysis**: CBS maintains A grade with minimal change. Strong performance across both foundation and comprehensive controls.

### 2. Santa Catalina School
**Status**: ✅ No Grade Change (Score Improved!)
- **Old Score**: 82% (B)
- **New Score**: 84% (B)
- **Foundation**: 86% - Certified
- **Comprehensive**: 82% - Strong
- **Change**: +2%

**Analysis**: Score actually **improved** under new model! Strong foundation compliance (86%) pulls up their overall grade. This demonstrates how organizations with solid foundation controls benefit from the weighted model.

### 3. Rosary College Prep
**Status**: ⚠️ **GRADE CHANGE: B → C**
- **Old Score**: 80% (B)
- **New Score**: 79% (C)
- **Foundation**: 79% - Below Certified Threshold
- **Comprehensive**: 80% - Adequate
- **Change**: -1%

**Analysis**: Drops from B to C due to foundation weaknesses. While comprehensive score is 80%, foundation score of 79% pulls down the weighted average. This highlights foundation gaps that need attention for cyber insurance compliance.

**Business Impact**: This grade change would trigger:
- Required foundation remediation plan
- More targeted assessment focus
- Clearer path to certification

---

### 4. Salesian College Prep
**Status**: ⚠️ Significant Score Drop (Same Grade)
- **Old Score**: 77% (C)
- **New Score**: 71% (C)
- **Foundation**: 67% - Below Foundation
- **Comprehensive**: 77% - Adequate
- **Change**: -6% (largest drop)

**Analysis**: Stays at C grade but shows **significant foundation weakness** (67%). The 6% score drop reflects critical gaps in cyber insurance requirements despite adequate comprehensive controls.

**Business Impact**: Foundation score of 67% indicates:
- Does not meet minimum cyber insurance requirements
- Critical foundation controls missing
- High priority remediation needed

---

## Methodology Comparison

### Old Method (Current)
```
Maturity Score = Calculate score from all 51 questions
Grade = Convert score to letter grade (A/B/C/D/F)
```

**Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward
- Treats all controls equally

**Cons**:
- Foundation gaps can be masked by strong performance in other areas
- Doesn't align with cyber insurance emphasis on core requirements
- No differentiation between critical and standard controls

---

### New Method (60/40 Weighted)
```
Foundation Score = Calculate score from 12 core questions
Comprehensive Score = Calculate score from all 51 questions
Maturity Score = (60% × Foundation) + (40% × Comprehensive)
Grade = Convert weighted score to letter grade
```

**Pros**:
- Emphasizes critical cyber insurance requirements
- Aligns with industry frameworks (CIS IG1/2 approach)
- Foundation gaps have appropriate impact on grade
- Rewards organizations with strong foundation compliance
- Provides clearer remediation priorities

**Cons**:
- More complex calculation
- May result in grade changes for some members

---

## Recommendation

**Implement the 60/40 weighted model** because:

1. **Better Risk Alignment**: Foundation controls are the minimum requirements for cyber insurance eligibility. Weighting them appropriately ensures grades reflect actual risk and insurability.

2. **Clearer Value Proposition**: Organizations can now see two distinct metrics:
   - Foundation Status: "Are we insurable?"
   - Security Maturity: "How mature is our overall security program?"

3. **Improved Guidance**: When an organization has foundation gaps (like Salesian at 67%), it becomes immediately clear what needs priority attention.

4. **Competitive Differentiation**: Organizations with strong foundation (like Santa Catalina) are properly recognized and rewarded.

5. **Industry Alignment**: Mirrors CIS IG1/2 approach where basic controls are prerequisites for advanced security maturity.

## Implementation Notes

### For Team Presentation
- Show side-by-side comparison of all 4 members
- Highlight that 75% of members maintain their grade
- Emphasize the 1 grade change (Rosary B→C) is appropriate given foundation gaps
- Note that Santa Catalina's score improvement demonstrates fairness

### Communication to Members
- **CBS**: "Maintain excellent A grade with strong foundation and comprehensive controls"
- **Santa Catalina**: "Upgraded score reflects your strong foundation compliance"
- **Rosary**: "Foundation gaps identified - remediation plan will help achieve B grade and certification"
- **Salesian**: "Critical foundation gaps require immediate attention for cyber insurance compliance"

### Documentation Updates Needed
1. Update Assessment Methodology section in report templates
2. Update member communications to explain dual scoring
3. Update pricing/service tiers to align with foundation certification
4. Create remediation plan templates for foundation gaps

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete grading simulation (DONE)
2. ⏳ Update Assessment Methodology section in report templates
3. ⏳ Generate POC reports for team review
4. ⏳ Present findings to team for approval
5. ⏳ Implement in production once approved
