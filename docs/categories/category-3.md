## Category 3: Data Protection and Privacy

### Overview

Data protection and privacy controls safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. This category addresses:
- Data inventory and classification
- Encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Data retention and secure deletion
- Privileged access management (PAM)
- Privacy compliance (FERPA, HIPAA, state privacy laws)
- Data loss prevention

**Framework Alignment:**
- **NIST CSF 2.0:** PR.DS (Data Security) - "Data is managed consistent with the organization's risk strategy"
- **CIS Controls v8:** Control 3 (Data Protection)

### Importance

**Why Data Protection Matters:**

1. **Breach Notification Laws:** All 50 states + DC require notification of data breaches involving PII
2. **Regulatory Fines:** HIPAA violations ($50K-$1.5M per violation), FERPA (loss of federal funding), state privacy laws ($7,500 per violation)
3. **Cyber Insurance Coverage:** First-party breach costs (notification, credit monitoring, legal defense) are primary coverage
4. **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches erode trust with students/patients/donors/customers
5. **Privilege Escalation:** Compromised privileged accounts enable attackers to access ALL organizational data

**Universal Threats:**
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data, demands payment for decryption key
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers steal sensitive data for sale on dark web or extortion
- **Insider Threats:** Employees with excessive access steal data before departure
- **Cloud Misconfiguration:** Publicly exposed cloud storage (S3 buckets, Azure blobs)
- **Unencrypted Data:** Laptops, USB drives, backups lost or stolen without encryption

**Sector-Specific Risks:**
- **Education:** Student education records (FERPA), SSNs, financial aid information
- **Healthcare:** Patient health information (HIPAA), medical records, billing data
- **Religious/Nonprofit:** Donor PII, credit card information, pastoral counseling notes
- **General:** Customer PII, financial data, trade secrets, intellectual property
