### Question 5.5: Email Authentication Protocols (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Has the organization implemented email authentication protocols including SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to prevent email spoofing and impersonation attacks?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Email authentication protocols work together to prevent domain spoofing and verify email legitimacy:

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**

- **Purpose:** Authorizes specific IP addresses to send email from your domain
- **DNS Record:** Publish SPF record listing authorized mail servers
- **Example:** "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all" (Google Workspace)

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**

- **Purpose:** Adds digital signature to verify message hasn't been tampered with in transit
- **Implementation:** Enable DKIM signing on outbound email server
- **Verification:** Receiving server checks signature against public key in DNS

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):**

- **Purpose:** Provides policy for handling emails failing SPF/DKIM checks + generates reports
- **Policies:**
  - **p=none:** Monitor mode (collect reports, no enforcement)
  - **p=quarantine:** Failed emails go to spam folder
  - **p=reject:** Failed emails rejected entirely (strongest protection)
- **Reports:** Daily XML reports showing email authentication results, spoofing attempts

**Full Implementation:**
1. **Publish SPF record** in DNS listing authorized mail servers
2. **Enable DKIM signing** on outbound email (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 admin consoles)
3. **Implement DMARC policy** starting with p=none for monitoring
4. **Monitor DMARC reports** to identify legitimate senders and spoofing attempts
5. **Strengthen DMARC to p=quarantine or p=reject** after validation period

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Email remains **#1 attack vector** with phishing as top initial access method across all sectors:

**Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks:**

- Cost billions annually
- Attackers impersonate executives, administrators, or vendors to request wire transfers or credential disclosure
- Email authentication prevents domain impersonation (attacker can't send email appearing to be from your domain)

**Coalition Cyber Insurance:**

- Specifically lists **email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)** on cyber insurance coverage checklist
- Many BEC losses are excluded or sub-limited in cyber policies, making **prevention critical**

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**IBM X-Force 2025:**

- **84% uptick in phishing emails** delivering infostealers
- Attackers increasingly use domain impersonation to appear legitimate

**Verizon DBIR 2024:**

- Phishing and pretexting remain **top causes of costly data breaches** (42% of attack patterns in education sector)
- Email-based social engineering dominates across all industries

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education (K-12/Higher Ed):**

- **K12 SIX (2024):** Updated framework for 2024-25 now considers **SPF and DKIM baseline protections**
- **Low Adoption:** Only 16% of Virginia school districts have implemented DMARC, just 8% with enforcement policies (p=quarantine/reject)
- **Superintendent Impersonation:** Common attack pattern - attacker impersonates superintendent to request wire transfers from business office
- **Parent Phishing:** Attackers impersonate school officials to phish parents for credentials, payment information
- **Practical Implementation:** Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 have built-in SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration; free DMARC monitoring tools (DMARC Analyzer, MXToolbox)

**Healthcare:**

- **CEO/CFO Impersonation:** Attackers target finance staff for wire transfers
- **Physician Impersonation:** Fake prescription requests, patient data requests
- **HIPAA:** Email authentication protects communications containing PHI from interception/manipulation
- **Practical Implementation:** Microsoft 365, Google Workspace built-in authentication

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Pastor/Priest Impersonation:** Attackers impersonate clergy to request donations or wire transfers from parishioners or staff
- **Donor Trust:** Email authentication protects organization's reputation (prevents spoofed fundraising emails)
- **Practical Implementation:** Free DMARC monitoring tools, built-in authentication in email platforms

**General Organizations:**

- **CFO/CEO Impersonation:** Classic BEC attack pattern

### Question 5.6: API Security Controls ðŸ†•

*(Note: This question is under consideration for removal/trading per AI_QUESTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md. Included here for completeness but may be deprioritized.)*

**Question Text:**
For organizations using APIs (application programming interfaces) to integrate systems or provide services, are API security controls implemented including authentication (OAuth 2.0), authorization, rate limiting, and API activity monitoring?

**Impact Rating:** Moderate (3)

**Foundational:** NO - Comprehensive maturity indicator (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

API security controls protect application programming interfaces from abuse and exploitation:

**Authentication:**

- **OAuth 2.0:** Industry-standard authorization framework for API access
- **API Keys:** Unique keys for each API client (rotate regularly)
- **Mutual TLS:** Certificate-based authentication for high-security APIs

**Authorization:**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different API permissions for different user roles
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Fine-grained permissions based on attributes
- **Least-Privilege:** Grant minimum API permissions necessary

**Rate Limiting:**

- **Throttling:** Limit API requests per client (e.g., 1000 requests/hour)
- **DDoS Protection:** Prevent abuse, resource exhaustion
- **Quotas:** Different rate limits for different subscription tiers

**Input Validation:**

- **Prevent Injection Attacks:** Sanitize user inputs (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- **Schema Validation:** Enforce expected data types, formats

**API Activity Monitoring:**

- **Logging:** All API requests/responses logged
- **Anomaly Detection:** Unusual access patterns trigger alerts
- **SIEM Integration:** API logs fed into SIEM for correlation

**API Inventory:**

- **Discover All APIs:** Public, internal, partner APIs
