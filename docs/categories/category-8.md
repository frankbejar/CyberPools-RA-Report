**Question Text:**
Does the organization vet artificial intelligence (AI) tools and platforms for data privacy, security controls, and compliance before approving for organizational use?

**Response Options:**

- Fully implemented - formal AI vetting process, approved AI tools list, DPAs reviewed
- Partially implemented - informal AI tool vetting, inconsistent
- Not implemented - no AI tool vetting process

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026 - Forward-Looking Control)

**Control Description:**

AI tool vetting ensures AI platforms meet organizational data privacy, security, and compliance requirements before adoption. This control works in conjunction with AI Acceptable Use Policy (Question 7.4). Effective AI vetting includes:

**AI Vetting Criteria:**

- **Data Privacy:**
  - Does AI vendor retain user inputs for model training? (Disqualifying for sensitive data)
  - Where is data stored? (Data residency requirements - EU, US, on-premise)
  - Can data be deleted upon request? (GDPR right to erasure)
  - Does vendor offer zero-retention options for enterprise customers?

- **Security Controls:**
  - Encryption (at rest, in transit)?
  - MFA supported for user accounts?
  - SOC 2 Type II certification?
  - Vulnerability disclosure program?
  - Incident response process?

- **Compliance:**
  - **HIPAA:** Does vendor sign Business Associate Agreement (BAA)?
  - **FERPA:** Does vendor meet student data privacy requirements?
  - **GDPR:** Is vendor GDPR-compliant? (Data Processing Agreement available?)
  - **AI-Specific:** Does vendor comply with EU AI Act (if applicable)?

- **AI-Specific Risks:**
  - **Model Transparency:** Does vendor disclose training data sources?
  - **Bias Mitigation:** Does vendor test for algorithmic bias?
  - **Hallucinations:** Does vendor acknowledge AI output may be inaccurate?
  - **Copyright:** Does vendor indemnify against copyright infringement?

**Enterprise vs. Public AI Tools:**

- **Public AI Tools:** ChatGPT (free), Claude (web), Gemini (free) typically **retain data for training**; not acceptable for sensitive/confidential data
- **Enterprise AI Tools:** Microsoft 365 Copilot, Google Gemini Workspace, AWS Bedrock offer **zero-retention, data residency, compliance** (HIPAA, FERPA, SOC 2)

**Approved AI Tools List:**

- Maintain list of vetted, approved AI tools (links to Question 7.4 AI AUP)
- **Example Enterprise Approvals:**
  - Microsoft 365 Copilot (FERPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, data residency)
  - Google Gemini for Workspace (FERPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, data residency)
  - AWS Bedrock (HIPAA-eligible, SOC 2, customer-controlled data)

**Vetting Process:**

- **Pre-Adoption:** IT/Security team vets AI tool before procurement approval
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):** For high-risk AI uses (GDPR requirement)
- **Contract Review:** Legal reviews AI vendor Data Processing Agreements, AI-specific terms
- **Approval Documentation:** Document vetting decision, approved use cases, prohibited uses

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**Emerging Insurance Requirement (2025-2026):**

- **Coalition "Affirmative AI Insurance"** (2024 launch) recommends AI tool vetting
- **Data Leakage Risk:** Insurers concerned about sensitive data entered into unvetted AI tools
- **Forward-Looking Control:** While not yet universally required, AI vetting anticipated to become standard by 2026

**Compliance Risk Mitigation:**

- **GDPR Violations:** Unvetted AI tools may violate data processing requirements (â‚¬20M fines)
- **HIPAA Breaches:** PHI entered into non-compliant AI tools triggers breach notification
- **FERPA Violations:** Student data in public AI tools violates FERPA
- AI vetting prevents unintentional compliance violations

**Vendor Risk Management Integration:**

- AI vendors are third-party vendors; vetting aligns with existing vendor risk program (Questions 8.1-8.7)
- SOC 2 certifications apply to AI vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft all have SOC 2)

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**Data Leakage via AI Tools:**

- **Samsung Leak (2023):** Engineers entered proprietary code into ChatGPT; Samsung banned ChatGPT
- **Amazon Leak (2023):** Employees entered confidential Amazon data into ChatGPT
- **Without vetting, employees use public AI tools with sensitive data** â†’ data leakage, compliance violations

**AI Training Data Retention:**

- **Public AI tools retain inputs for model training** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google free tiers)
- Organizational data becomes part of AI training corpus, accessible to other users
- Enterprise AI tools (Microsoft 365 Copilot, Google Workspace) offer zero-retention

**Compliance Violations:**

- **FERPA/COPPA:** Teachers entering student data into ChatGPT violates student privacy laws
- **HIPAA:** Healthcare staff entering PHI into public AI tools triggers breach notification (60-day deadline, potential OCR fines)
- **GDPR:** AI processing personal data requires GDPR compliance (DPAs, data residency)
- AI vetting identifies compliant tools before data exposure occurs

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education (K-12/Higher Ed):**

- **Vetting Focus:** FERPA compliance, COPPA (K-12), student data privacy, AI model training data retention

- **Approved Enterprise AI Tools:**
  - **Microsoft 365 Copilot for Education:** FERPA-compliant, no student data used for training, data residency in US
  - **Google Gemini for Workspace Education:** FERPA-compliant, Student Data Privacy Agreement, no training on student data
  - **Khan Academy Khanmigo:** Education-specific AI, FERPA-compliant, SOC 2 certified

- **Prohibited Public AI Tools (for student data):**
  - ChatGPT (free tier), Claude (web), Gemini (free) - retain inputs for training, not FERPA-compliant

- **Practical Implementation:**
  - IT approves AI tools before purchase; maintains approved AI tools list
  - Review vendor FERPA Data Privacy Agreements, Student Data Privacy Pledges (studentprivacypledge.org)
  - Training: "Use approved AI tools (Copilot, Gemini Workspace) for lesson planning; don't enter student names, grades, IEPs into ChatGPT"

- **K-12 Specific Risks:** Teachers lack awareness of FERPA implications; clear approved tools list essential
