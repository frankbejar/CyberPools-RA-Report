## Category 4: Secure Configuration and Vulnerability Management

### Overview

Secure configuration and vulnerability management ensures that systems are hardened against attack and that known vulnerabilities are identified and remediated in a timely manner. This category addresses:

- Network security architecture (firewalls, segmentation, DMZ)
- System hardening and secure baselines
- Patch management processes
- Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- Wireless network security
- Centralized logging and security monitoring (SIEM)
- Cloud security posture management
- Remote access security controls

**Framework Alignment:**

- **NIST CSF 2.0:** PR.IP (Protective Technology) - "Security configurations are managed and maintained"
- **CIS Controls v8:** Control 4 (Secure Configuration), Control 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)

### Importance

**Why Secure Configuration and Vulnerability Management Matters:**

1. **50% of Vulnerabilities Remain Unpatched:** Organizations struggle to patch known vulnerabilities (Verizon DBIR 2024)
2. **Attackers Exploit Known CVEs:** Vulnerabilities exploited within days of disclosure (zero-day race)
3. **Default Configurations Are Insecure:** Out-of-box systems have unnecessary services, weak passwords, excessive permissions
4. **Cloud Misconfigurations:** 95% of cloud breaches stem from misconfigurations (industry research 2024-2025)
5. **Detection Gap:** Average 212 days to detect breach without centralized logging (IBM X-Force 2025)

**Universal Threats:**

- **Unpatched Systems:** Attackers scan internet for vulnerable systems (EternalBlue, Log4Shell, etc.)
- **Default Credentials:** Routers, firewalls, IoT devices with default admin/admin passwords
- **Unnecessary Services:** Attack surface expanded by unused services (FTP, Telnet, SMBv1)
- **Firewall Misconfigurations:** Overly permissive rules allowing unauthorized access
- **Cloud Storage Exposure:** Publicly accessible S3 buckets, Azure blobs with sensitive data

**Sector-Specific Risks:**

- **Education:** Forgotten web servers, unpatched student information systems, open wireless networks
- **Healthcare:** Medical devices with unpatched firmware, legacy radiology systems, HL7 interface vulnerabilities
- **Religious/Nonprofit:** Donated equipment with unknown security status, volunteer-managed networks
- **General:** Operational technology (OT/ICS) with long patch cycles, legacy business-critical systems

### Question 4.15: Cloud Security Configuration Management ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Does the organization use cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools or processes to continuously monitor and remediate misconfigurations in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** NO - Comprehensive maturity indicator (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) involves continuous assessment of cloud infrastructure configurations against security best practices and compliance frameworks:

**CSPM Scope:**

- **Cloud Storage:** S3 buckets (AWS), Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage - check for public access
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Overly permissive roles, unused service accounts, MFA gaps
- **Network Security Groups:** Firewall rules allowing unnecessary inbound access
- **Encryption Settings:** Verify encryption at rest and in transit enabled
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Ensure CloudTrail (AWS), Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Logging enabled
- **Compliance Benchmarks:** CIS Benchmarks for AWS/Azure/GCP, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA

**CSPM Tools:**

- **Native Cloud Tools:**

  - AWS Security Hub (aggregates findings from AWS Config, GuardDuty, Inspector)
  - Azure Security Center / Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  - Google Security Command Center
  - Microsoft Secure Score (for Microsoft 365)
  - Google Workspace Security Health
- **Third-Party CSPM:** Prisma Cloud (Palo Alto), Wiz, Orca Security, Lacework
- **Open Source:** CloudSploit, Prowler (AWS), ScoutSuite

**Configuration Monitoring:**

- **Continuous Scanning:** Real-time detection of misconfigurations
- **Automated Remediation:** Auto-fix common issues (disable public S3 bucket access)
- **Alerting:** Notify security team of critical misconfigurations
- **Compliance Dashboard:** View compliance status against frameworks (CIS, NIST, PCI DSS)

**Common Cloud Misconfigurations:**

- **Public S3 Buckets:** Unintentional public access to sensitive data
- **Overly Permissive IAM:** Admin rights granted broadly instead of least-privilege
- **Disabled Encryption:** Data stored unencrypted in cloud
- **Disabled Logging:** CloudTrail, Azure logs turned off, preventing audit trail
- **Open Security Groups:** Firewall rules allowing 0.0.0.0/0 (entire internet) access to SSH/RDP

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**95% of cloud breaches stem from misconfigurations** (GBHackers 2025), making CSPM essential for risk mitigation. As organizations adopt multi-cloud environments, insurers assess cloud security controls during underwriting:

**Insurer Concerns:**

- **Publicly Exposed Storage:** S3 buckets with PII, PHI, financial data accessible to internet
- **Overly Permissive IAM:** Enables lateral movement if single account compromised
- **Disabled Encryption/Logging:** Violates HIPAA, PCI DSS requirements
- **Compliance Failures:** NIST, CIS benchmark violations indicate immature security

Cloud-native applications and SaaS platforms are now primary attack surfaces for all sectors. Insurers increasingly require evidence of cloud security monitoring.

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**Industry Research (2024-2025):**

- **95% of cloud breaches result from misconfigurations** (GBHackers 2025)
- Organizations need visibility across multi-cloud deployments regardless of sector
- "Proliferation of sophisticated attacks and challenge of managing dynamic cloud assets underscore critical need for advanced cloud security" (Orca Security 2025)

**Sector-Specific Context:**

- **FERPA:** Proper access controls, encryption, monitoring required for cloud-based education records

**Healthcare:**

- **EHR Systems in Cloud:** Epic on AWS, Cerner on Azure, cloud-based medical imaging (PACS)
- **HIPAA 2025 Security Rule:** Encryption mandated for ePHI at rest and in transit (cloud storage must be encrypted)
- **Cloud Misconfigurations:** Can expose patient health information (PHI)
- **Practical Implementation:** Azure Security Center for Azure-hosted EHR, AWS Security Hub for AWS

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Cloud Services:** Microsoft 365, Google Workspace for donor communications, financial records
- **Donor Management:** Cloud-based platforms (Blackbaud, Planning Center)
- **Misconfigurations:** Can expose donor PII, credit card information
- **Practical Implementation:** Microsoft Secure Score, Google Workspace Security Health (free built-in tools)

**General Organizations:**

- **Multi-Cloud Environments:** AWS for infrastructure, Azure for SaaS, Google for productivity
- **Compliance:** SOX, PCI DSS, state privacy laws extend to cloud environments
- **Operational Technology (OT):** Increasingly cloud-managed

### Question 4.16: Secure Remote Access Controls ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Beyond MFA, does the organization implement additional remote access security controls such as conditional access policies (device compliance, location-based access), network access control (NAC), or zero-trust network access (ZTNA)?

**Impact Rating:** Moderate (3)

**Foundational:** NO - Comprehensive maturity indicator (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Enhanced remote access security goes beyond VPN+MFA to include:

**Conditional Access Policies:**

- **Device Health Checks:** OS version current, encryption enabled, EDR running before granting access
- **Location-Based Policies:** Block access from high-risk countries, unusual geolocations
- **Risk-Based Authentication:** Unusual location/time triggers additional verification (step-up MFA)
- **Application-Specific Access:** Different requirements for email vs. financial systems

**Network Access Control (NAC):**

- **Device Posture Assessment:** Check device compliance before network access
- **Automated Quarantine:** Non-compliant devices moved to remediation VLAN
- **Guest Network Enforcement:** Automatically redirect unknown devices to guest network

**Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA):**

- **Application-Level Access:** Grant access to specific applications, not entire network (vs. traditional VPN)
- **Least-Privilege Access:** Per-application access control
- **Continuous Verification:** Regularly re-authenticate and re-authorize during session

**Split Tunneling Controls:**

- **Full Tunnel VPN:** All traffic routes through VPN (more secure, impacts performance)
- **Split Tunnel VPN:** Only corporate traffic through VPN, internet direct (less secure, better performance)
- **Policy-Based Split Tunneling:** Microsoft 365 traffic direct, sensitive apps through VPN

**Remote Desktop Security:**

- **Disable RDP from Internet:** No direct RDP access from public internet
- **Require VPN+MFA for RDP:** Two-factor authentication before RDP access
- **RDP Gateway:** Centralized RDP gateway with MFA, audit logging
- **Limit RDP to Specific IP Ranges:** Restrict RDP access to known IP addresses

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Remote work expanded attack surface post-COVID:

- **Coalition:** 82% of cyber insurance claims involved organizations lacking MFA
- **MFA Alone Insufficient:** Conditional access adds device compliance, location verification
- **BYOD Security:** Bring-Your-Own-Device policies require device compliance checks

**Insurers Assess:**

- Device compliance requirements (managed vs. unmanaged devices)
- Conditional access policies reducing risk-based access
- BYOD security controls
- VPN+MFA implementation quality (split tunneling risks, weak VPN protocols)

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**IBM X-Force 2025:**

- **Most ransomware attacks start with compromised VPNs and remote access credentials**
- Advanced techniques exploit remote access technologies

**Verizon DBIR 2024:**

- Remote access exploitation is top attack path
- Attackers scan for VPN endpoints and attempt credential stuffing

**Sector-Specific Context:**
