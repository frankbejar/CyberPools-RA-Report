## Category 1: Asset Inventory and Management

### Overview

Asset inventory and management forms the foundation of effective cybersecurity. Organizations cannot protect what they don't know exists. This category addresses:
- Hardware asset inventory (servers, workstations, mobile devices, network equipment)
- Software asset inventory (operating systems, applications, licenses)
- Cloud service inventory (SaaS platforms, IaaS/PaaS usage)
- Emerging technology assets (IoT devices, AI tools)
- Asset ownership and lifecycle management

**Framework Alignment:**
- **NIST CSF 2.0:** ID.AM (Asset Management) - "Assets are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance"
- **CIS Controls v8:** Control 1 (Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets), Control 2 (Inventory and Control of Software Assets)

### Importance

**Why Asset Inventory Matters:**

1. **Attack Surface Visibility:** Unknown assets create security blind spots that attackers exploit (shadow IT, forgotten servers, unmanaged devices)
2. **Vulnerability Management:** Cannot patch or secure assets you don't know exist
3. **Incident Response:** Complete asset inventory enables rapid identification of affected systems during breaches
4. **License Compliance:** Software inventory prevents license violations and identifies end-of-life software requiring replacement
5. **Insurance Requirements:** Cyber insurance applications ask for counts of servers, workstations, and critical systems

**Universal Threats:**
- **Unmanaged Devices:** Personal laptops, smartphones connecting to corporate networks without security controls
- **Shadow IT:** Unapproved cloud services (file sharing, collaboration tools) storing organizational data
- **Forgotten Assets:** Legacy servers still accessible from internet but no longer maintained
- **End-of-Life Software:** Systems running Windows Server 2008, Adobe Flash, or other unsupported software with known vulnerabilities

**Sector-Specific Risks:**
- **Education:** Student/teacher personal devices (BYOD), forgotten web servers hosting student data, end-of-life student information systems
- **Healthcare:** Medical devices running embedded Windows XP, radiology workstations, forgotten PACS servers
- **Religious/Nonprofit:** Volunteer-owned devices, donated equipment of unknown age/security status
- **General:** Operational technology (OT/ICS) devices, IoT sensors, contractor-owned equipment

### Question 1.4: End-of-Life Software Management ๐ FOUNDATIONAL

**Question Text:**
Has the organization identified and removed or isolated all software and operating systems that are end-of-life (no longer supported by the vendor)?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ๐ YES - Insurance Critical (Trust Requirement #1 for Education)

**Control Description:**

End-of-life (EOL) software is software that the vendor no longer supports with security patches or updates. Common examples:
- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server 2008/2012, Windows 7/8, macOS versions older than 3 years, Ubuntu LTS past support date
- **Applications:** Adobe Flash, Internet Explorer, older versions of Java, Microsoft Office 2010/2013
- **Databases:** SQL Server 2008, Oracle 11g, MySQL 5.5
- **Web Servers:** Apache 2.2, IIS 6.0

**EOL Software Management Process:**
1. **Discovery:** Identify all EOL software via software inventory (see Question 1.2)
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate business criticality and exposure (internet-facing vs. internal)
3. **Mitigation Options:**
   - **Upgrade:** Migrate to supported version (preferred)
   - **Replace:** Migrate to alternative supported software
   - **Isolate:** Network segmentation if immediate replacement impossible (temporary)
   - **Decommission:** Turn off if no longer needed
4. **Timeline:** Establish upgrade/replacement timeline (typically 6-12 months)
5. **Exceptions:** Document exceptions with compensating controls (air-gapped systems, vendor-managed medical devices)

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**Critical Insurance Concern:**
- EOL software has **known, unpatched vulnerabilities** that attackers actively exploit
- **WannaCry ransomware (2017):** Exploited Windows XP/Server 2003 systems (EOL at time)
- **NotPetya (2017):** Similar exploitation of unsupported systems

Cyber insurance carriers:
- May **deny coverage** for breaches originating from EOL software (negligence)
- Require attestation that EOL software has been removed or isolated
- Some carriers offer reduced premiums for organizations with no EOL software

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **50% of perimeter vulnerabilities remain unpatched** (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- EOL software creates **permanent vulnerability** (patches will never be released)
- Attackers maintain exploit databases for EOL software (Windows XP, Server 2008)
- **Supply chain attacks:** Outdated web servers, databases enable attackers to compromise organizations

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**
- **Common EOL Software:** Windows Server 2008/2012 running student information systems, older macOS on teacher laptops, Adobe Flash for legacy learning content
- **Challenge:** Budget constraints delay upgrades; testing compatibility with educational software
- **FERPA:** EOL systems with student data create data breach risk

**Healthcare:**
- **Common EOL Software:** Windows XP/7 embedded in medical devices (infusion pumps, imaging equipment), older EHR systems
- **Challenge:** Medical devices have long lifecycles (10-15 years); vendor controls firmware updates
- **HIPAA 2025 Security Rule:** Enhanced security requirements may mandate medical device upgrades
- **Compensating Controls:** Network segmentation isolates medical devices from general network

**Religious/Nonprofit:**
- **Common EOL Software:** Windows Server 2008 for file sharing, Office 2010, outdated accounting software
- **Challenge:** Limited IT budgets, reliance on donated equipment, lack of IT expertise

**General:**
- **Common EOL Software:** Legacy industrial control systems (OT/ICS), mainframes, specialized business applications
- **Challenge:** Custom applications built for EOL platforms, high migration costs

**Citations:**
- **The Trust (Education Insurance):** Requirement #1 - End-of-life software management
- **Coalition:** Cyber insurance applications ask: "Are any systems running unsupported operating systems?"
- CIS Controls v8: Control 2.2 (Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported)
- NIST CSF 2.0: ID.AM-2 (Software inventory), PR.IP-2 (Secure software development lifecycle)
- **WannaCry Case Study:** 2017 ransomware attack exploited Windows XP/Server 2003 (EOL), cost organizations $4 billion globally
