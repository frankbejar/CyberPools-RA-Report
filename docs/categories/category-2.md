## Category 2: Account Management and Access Control

### Overview

Account management and access control ensures that only authorized individuals can access organizational systems and data, with permissions appropriate to their role. This category addresses:
- User account lifecycle (creation, modification, deactivation)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all access points
- Privileged access management (PAM) for administrator accounts
- Password policies and credential management
- Access review and recertification processes

**Framework Alignment:**
- **NIST CSF 2.0:** PR.AC (Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control) - "Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users"
- **CIS Controls v8:** Control 5 (Account Management), Control 6 (Access Control Management)

### Importance

**Why Account Management Matters:**

1. **#1 Attack Vector:** Credential abuse is the most common initial access method (30% of incidents - IBM X-Force 2025)
2. **88% of Breaches:** Involve stolen or compromised credentials (Verizon DBIR 2024)
3. **Insurance Requirement:** 82% of cyber insurance claims involved organizations lacking MFA (Coalition 2024)
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers target privileged accounts for maximum impact (lateral movement, data exfiltration, ransomware deployment)
5. **Insider Threats:** Former employees with active accounts, excessive permissions, or shared credentials create risk

**Universal Threats:**
- **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use breached credentials from other sites to access organizational systems
- **Phishing:** Social engineering to trick users into revealing passwords or MFA codes
- **Brute Force:** Automated password guessing against accounts without MFA
- **Privilege Abuse:** Compromised privileged accounts enable ransomware deployment and data theft
- **Orphaned Accounts:** Former employee accounts remaining active after termination

**Sector-Specific Risks:**
- **Education:** Shared teacher accounts, student accounts not deactivated after graduation, summer staff turnover
- **Healthcare:** Shared clinical staff accounts, vendor/contractor accounts with excessive permissions, physicians using personal devices
- **Religious/Nonprofit:** Volunteer accounts with undefined lifecycle, shared passwords for ministry tools
- **General:** Contractor/vendor accounts, service accounts with static passwords, excessive administrative permissions

### Question 2.1: User Account Lifecycle Management

**Question Text:**
Does the organization have a formal process for user account creation, modification, and deactivation aligned with hiring, role changes, and termination?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

User account lifecycle management includes:

**Account Creation:**
- Formal request and approval process (manager authorization)
- Role-based access provisioning (access based on job function)
- Integration with HR onboarding process
- Account naming conventions and email address standards
- New user security training completion before account activation

**Account Modification:**
- Role change process (promotion, department transfer, contractor conversion)
- Access recertification when responsibilities change
- Temporary access elevation for projects (time-limited)
- Integration with HR change management

**Account Deactivation:**
- Termination procedures (disable account immediately upon notification)
- Resignation procedures (disable account on last day)
- Leave of absence procedures (temporary disable)
- Automated deactivation based on HR system integration
- Account deletion after retention period (30-90 days post-termination)

**Access Reviews:**
- Quarterly or annual review of active accounts
- Manager attestation of team member access appropriateness
- Removal of unused accounts (dormant >90 days)
- Shared account identification and elimination

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Orphaned accounts (former employees) are prime targets for attackers:
- No monitoring (former employee won't report suspicious activity)
- Often retain elevated permissions from last role
- Credential reuse (employee may use same password elsewhere that gets breached)

Cyber insurance claims frequently involve:
- Terminated employee accessing systems post-termination (data theft, sabotage)
- Contractor accounts persisting beyond project completion
- Shared accounts preventing accountability during incidents

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Insider Threats:** Disgruntled former employees with active accounts can access systems remotely
- **Credential Reuse:** Former employee credentials appear in breach databases; attackers try them against organizational systems
- **Verizon DBIR 2024:** Orphaned accounts and excessive permissions frequently exploited

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**
- **High Turnover:** Teachers, substitutes, student teachers, summer staff create frequent account changes
- **Student Accounts:** Graduating seniors, transferring students require systematic deactivation
- **Challenge:** Summer transitions (June-August) create account management backlog

**Healthcare:**
- **Clinical Staff Mobility:** Nurses, physicians rotating through departments require role-based access changes
- **Vendor/Contractor Access:** Medical device technicians, consultants need time-limited access
- **HIPAA:** Access controls and workforce clearinghouse procedures required (Â§164.308(a)(3))

**Religious/Nonprofit:**
- **Volunteer Turnover:** High volunteer churn requires systematic account deactivation
- **Seasonal Staff:** Summer camps, holiday programs create temporary account needs
- **Challenge:** Limited HR infrastructure; manual account management

**Citations:**
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.1 (Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Accounts)
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.2 (Use Unique Passwords)
- NIST CSF 2.0: PR.AC-1 (Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked)
- HIPAA Security Rule: Â§164.308(a)(3)(i) - Workforce clearance procedures

### Question 2.2: Password Policy

**Question Text:**
Does the organization enforce a password policy requiring minimum length, complexity, and regular password changes (or passphrase/password manager usage)?

**Impact Rating:** Moderate (3)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

Modern password policies align with NIST SP 800-63B guidance:

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Length:** Minimum 12-15 characters (passphrases preferred over complexity rules)
- **Complexity:** No strict complexity requirements if length â‰¥15 characters; otherwise require uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- **Password Managers:** Encourage or require password manager usage for generating/storing unique passwords
- **Passphrases:** Allow spaces and long phrases (e.g., "coffee-morning-sunshine-24")

**What NOT to Require (Outdated Practices):**
- **NO forced periodic password changes** (causes users to make predictable changes: Password1 â†’ Password2)
- **NO password hints** (often reveal answers)
- **NO security questions** (easily guessable or publicly available answers)

**Best Practices:**
- **Breach Detection:** Check passwords against known breach databases (Have I Been Pwned API)
- **No Password Reuse:** Prevent users from reusing previous passwords
- **Account Lockout:** Temporary lockout after failed login attempts (5-10 attempts)
- **MFA Requirement:** Reduce password reliance through multi-factor authentication (see Questions 2.3-2.6)

**Technical Enforcement:**
- Active Directory Group Policy or Azure AD Password Protection
- Password filters or validators
- Self-service password reset with identity verification

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

While password policies alone are insufficient protection, they remain baseline security hygiene. Weak passwords combined with lack of MFA create critical vulnerability.

Insurers assess:
- Minimum password length requirements (8+ characters minimum, 12+ preferred)
- MFA implementation (far more critical than password policy)
- Password manager deployment for IT/admin staff

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use breached credentials from other sites; password reuse across sites is common
- **Brute Force:** Short, simple passwords vulnerable to automated guessing
- **Phishing:** Strong passwords still vulnerable to phishing; MFA is essential defense

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**
- **Challenge:** Students/teachers resist complex passwords; password manager training needed
- **Student Accounts:** Age-appropriate password policies (elementary vs. high school)
- **FERPA:** Passwords protect access to student education records

**Healthcare:**
- **Challenge:** Clinical staff need rapid access during patient care; complex passwords slow workflow
- **HIPAA 2025 Security Rule:** Enhanced password requirements expected in final rule
- **Solution:** Biometric authentication or badge readers combined with PIN

**Religious/Nonprofit:**
- **Challenge:** Older volunteers/congregation members unfamiliar with password managers
- **Solution:** Passphrase approach (memorable but long)

**Citations:**
- **NIST SP 800-63B:** Digital Identity Guidelines (modern password guidance)
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.2 (Use Unique Passwords)
- NIST CSF 2.0: PR.AC-1 (Credentials are managed)
- HIPAA Security Rule: Â§164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D) - Password management

### Question 2.7: Privileged Account Separation

**Question Text:**
Are privileged administrative functions performed using dedicated administrative accounts (not regular user accounts)?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

Privileged account separation means:
- **Separate Accounts:** Administrators have TWO accounts:
  - **Regular User Account:** For email, web browsing, daily work (john.smith@org.edu)
  - **Admin Account:** For administrative tasks only (john.smith-admin@org.edu or admin-jsmith)
- **No Dual-Use Accounts:** Never use admin account for email, web browsing, or daily tasks
- **Elevated Access Only When Needed:** Admin account used only for administrative tasks, then logged out

**Implementation:**
- Active Directory: Separate OU for admin accounts with restrictive GPOs
- Azure AD: Separate admin accounts or Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time admin access
- Workstation Restriction: Admin accounts cannot log into regular workstations (only jump servers/admin workstations)

**Rationale:**
- **Phishing Protection:** Admin account not used for email, so cannot be phished
- **Malware Protection:** Admin account not used for web browsing, so malware cannot compromise admin credentials
- **Audit Trail:** Clear separation of administrative actions vs. regular user activity

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Privileged account separation is core component of **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**:
- BeyondTrust: "Removing admin rights from workstations" is basic requirement of cyber insurers
- Prevents **privilege escalation** attacks where malware on user workstation compromises admin credentials

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- Dual-use admin accounts create **phishing vulnerability**: Admin clicks malicious email link â†’ malware runs with admin privileges
- **Pass-the-Hash Attacks:** Malware on workstation steals cached admin credentials
- **Lateral Movement:** Compromised admin account on one system enables lateral movement across network

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**
- **Small IT Teams:** 1-3 IT staff often use personal email accounts as admin accounts
- **Best Practice:** Separate admin account even for small teams

**Healthcare:**
- **EHR Administrators:** Separate account for EHR admin tasks vs. clinical documentation
- **HIPAA:** Administrative access should be separate from clinical access for audit purposes

**Religious/Nonprofit:**
- **Volunteer IT:** Separate admin account from personal volunteer account

**Citations:**
- **BeyondTrust:** "Removing admin rights and enforcing PoLP" basic insurance requirement
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.4 (Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Accounts)
- NIST CSF 2.0: PR.AC-4 (Access permissions are managed)
- Microsoft Security Baseline: Separate admin accounts recommended

### Question 2.8: Access Review and Recertification

**Question Text:**
Does the organization conduct periodic reviews (at least annually) of user access rights to ensure they remain appropriate for current job responsibilities?

**Impact Rating:** Moderate (3)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

Access review process includes:
- **Quarterly or Annual Reviews:** Manager attestation that team members have appropriate access
- **Role Change Reviews:** Immediate review when employee changes roles, promoted, or transfers departments
- **Privileged Access Reviews:** Quarterly review of all administrative accounts
- **Shared Account Audit:** Identify and eliminate shared accounts
- **Dormant Account Removal:** Disable accounts inactive >90 days

**Review Process:**
1. Generate access reports from systems (Active Directory, cloud services, applications)
2. Distribute to department managers for review
3. Managers certify access is appropriate or request changes
4. IT implements approved changes (remove excessive permissions)
5. Document reviews for compliance audit trail

**Automated Tools:**
- **Identity Governance:** Tools like SailPoint, Okta Identity Governance automate access reviews
- **Azure AD Access Reviews:** Built-in access review workflows for Microsoft 365
- **Manual Reviews:** Excel spreadsheets for smaller organizations

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Access creep (accumulation of permissions over time) creates risk:
- Employees retain permissions from previous roles
- Excessive permissions enable insider threats or account compromise
- Demonstrates governance maturity to insurers

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Insider Threats:** Disgruntled employees with excessive permissions can cause significant damage
- **Compromised Accounts:** Attackers with access to over-privileged account have larger impact
- **Compliance:** SOX, HIPAA, FERPA require periodic access reviews

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**
- **Teacher Role Changes:** Teacher moves from elementary to high school, access should change
- **Student Graduation:** Annual review identifies graduated students with active accounts

**Healthcare:**
- **HIPAA:** Access reviews required under Security Rule (Â§164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C))
- **Clinical Staff Rotation:** Nurses, physicians rotating through departments need access adjustments

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

**Final Actions (30-90 Days):**
- **Account Deletion:** Delete account after retention period
- **License Reclamation:** Recover software licenses for reassignment
- **Audit Trail:** Document all off-boarding actions

**Integration with HR:**
- HR system triggers IT off-boarding workflow
- Automated account disable on termination date in HR system
- Resignation off-boarding checklist

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Terminated employee accounts are **high-risk:**
- Disgruntled former employees may sabotage systems, steal data, or leak confidential information
- Attackers may compromise terminated employee accounts (no monitoring, credentials in breaches)
- Cyber insurance claims frequently involve former employee access

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Insider Threats:** Terminated employees are highest risk for malicious insider activity
- **Credential Reuse:** Former employee credentials appear in breach databases; attackers try them
- **Remote Access:** Work-from-home era makes immediate physical retrieval of equipment difficult

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**
- **End of School Year:** Mass terminations (retiring teachers, graduating student workers) require systematic off-boarding
- **Challenge:** Teachers terminated in May may have active accounts through August

**Healthcare:**
- **Clinical Staff Departures:** Physicians, nurses leaving must lose PHI access immediately
- **HIPAA:** Terminated workforce members must have access revoked immediately

**Religious/Nonprofit:**
