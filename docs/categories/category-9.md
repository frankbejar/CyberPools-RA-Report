## Category 9: Incident Response and Recovery

**Overview:**

Incident response and recovery capabilities enable organizations to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents effectively. Despite best preventive efforts, security incidents will occur - mature incident response processes minimize damage, reduce recovery time, and ensure compliance with breach notification requirements.

**Importance:**

**Inevitable Security Incidents:**

- **68% of organizations experience material cybersecurity incidents** annually (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- **Average breach detection time: 212 days** (IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024)
- **Average recovery time: 21 days** for ransomware without tested IR plan (Veeam 2024)
- Organizations with IR plans recover 3-5x faster than those without

**Insurance Requirements:**

- Cyber insurers **require documented incident response plans** for coverage
- **Incident response testing** (tabletop exercises) increasingly required
- **Cyber insurance coverage** itself is becoming a recommended control
- Breach notification deadlines (HIPAA 60 days, state laws 30-90 days) require rapid IR

**Sector-Agnostic Relevance:**

- **All sectors** experience cybersecurity incidents (phishing, ransomware, data breaches)
- IR applies universally across Education, Healthcare, Religious/Nonprofit, General organizations
- **Regulatory compliance** (HIPAA, state privacy laws, FERPA) requires breach response capabilities

**Category 9 includes 7 questions:**

- Question 9.1: Incident Response Plan
- Question 9.2: Incident Response Team
- Question 9.3: Incident Response Testing
- Question 9.4: Tabletop Exercises
- Question 9.5: Cyber Insurance Coverage
