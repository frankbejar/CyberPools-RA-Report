## Cyber Essential Controls (Foundational Questions)

### Overview

**Cyber Essential Controls** represent the **17 foundational questions** that are critical for cyber insurance eligibility and defense against the most prevalent threats. These controls address:

1. The most common attack vectors (credential abuse, phishing, ransomware)
2. Cyber insurance application requirements from major carriers
3. Regulatory baseline expectations (HIPAA, FERPA, state privacy laws)
4. Cost-effective, high-impact security measures suitable for organizations of all sizes

Organizations must prioritize implementation of these foundational controls to:
- Qualify for cyber insurance coverage or avoid exclusions/sub-limits
- Reduce risk of the most common and costly breaches
- Demonstrate baseline security due diligence to stakeholders, regulators, and insurers
- Establish security foundation for comprehensive maturity growth

### The Trust Requirements Mapping (Education Sector)

For education insurance pools, the **7 Trust Requirements** map to **12 foundational questions** in the assessment:

| Trust Requirement | Assessment Questions | Control Focus |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|

| **2. Multi-Factor Authentication** | 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 | MFA for VPN, cloud services, admin accounts, remote access |
| **3. Patch Management** | 4.3 | Vulnerability patching process |
| **4. Vulnerability Scanning** | 4.7 | External vulnerability scanning |
| **5. Endpoint Protection** | 5.4 | EDR/antivirus deployment |
| **6. Backup and Recovery** | 6.3, 6.4 | Air-gapped backups, backup testing |
| **7. Security Awareness** | 7.2, 7.3 | Phishing testing, security training |

### Insurance Impact of Foundational Controls

**High Insurance Pressure (Mandatory or Near-Mandatory):**
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (Questions 2.3-2.6) - **82% of cyber insurance claims involved orgs lacking MFA**
2. Endpoint Detection and Response (Question 5.4) - **Universal requirement from all carriers**
3. Air-gapped Backups (Question 6.3) - **Required by Coalition, Corvus, Chubb**
4. Privileged Access Management (Question 3.5) - **42% of orgs required to have PAM in 2024**
5. Email Authentication (Question 5.5) - **Coalition explicitly lists DMARC/SPF/DKIM on checklist**

**Moderate-High Insurance Pressure (Strongly Preferred):**
6. Patch Management (Question 4.3) - **50% of perimeter vulnerabilities remain unpatched (Verizon DBIR)**
7. External Vulnerability Scanning (Question 4.7) - **Required quarterly by most carriers**
