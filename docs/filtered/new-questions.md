### Question 5.5: Email Authentication Protocols (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Has the organization implemented email authentication protocols including SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to prevent email spoofing and impersonation attacks?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Email authentication protocols work together to prevent domain spoofing and verify email legitimacy:

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**

- **Purpose:** Authorizes specific IP addresses to send email from your domain
- **DNS Record:** Publish SPF record listing authorized mail servers
- **Example:** "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all" (Google Workspace)

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**

- **Purpose:** Adds digital signature to verify message hasn't been tampered with in transit
- **Implementation:** Enable DKIM signing on outbound email server
- **Verification:** Receiving server checks signature against public key in DNS

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):**

- **Purpose:** Provides policy for handling emails failing SPF/DKIM checks + generates reports
- **Policies:**

  - **p=none:** Monitor mode (collect reports, no enforcement)
  - **p=quarantine:** Failed emails go to spam folder
  - **p=reject:** Failed emails rejected entirely (strongest protection)
- **Reports:** Daily XML reports showing email authentication results, spoofing attempts

**Full Implementation:**

1. **Publish SPF record** in DNS listing authorized mail servers
2. **Enable DKIM signing** on outbound email (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 admin consoles)
3. **Implement DMARC policy** starting with p=none for monitoring
4. **Monitor DMARC reports** to identify legitimate senders and spoofing attempts
5. **Strengthen DMARC to p=quarantine or p=reject** after validation period

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Email remains **#1 attack vector** with phishing as top initial access method across all sectors:

**Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks:**

### Question 9.7: Incident Detection and Response Capabilities (MTTD/MTTR) ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Does the organization measure and track incident detection and response metrics such as Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)?

**Response Options:**

- Fully implemented - MTTD/MTTR tracked, continuous improvement process, metrics reported to leadership
- Partially implemented - informal metrics tracking, no continuous improvement
- Not implemented - no incident detection/response metrics

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** No (but emerging best practice)

**Control Description:**

Incident detection and response metrics enable organizations to measure IR effectiveness and drive continuous improvement. Key metrics include:

**Key IR Metrics:**

- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** Average time from incident occurrence to detection
  - **Industry Average:** 212 days (IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024)
  - **Target:** <24 hours for mature organizations

- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** Average time from detection to containment
  - **Target:** <1 hour for critical incidents

- **Mean Time to Recover (MTTR Recovery):** Average time to restore normal operations
  - **Ransomware Average:** 21 days without tested plan, 5-7 days with tested plan

**Additional IR Metrics:**

- **Incident Count:** Number of incidents by type, severity
- **False Positive Rate:** SIEM alerts requiring investigation vs. true incidents
- **Escalation Time:** Time to escalate incidents to IR team, executives
- **Breach Notification Compliance:** % of breaches notified within legal deadlines

**Metrics Tracking:**

- **SIEM/Security Tools:** Automated MTTD tracking via SIEM alert timestamps
- **Incident Tickets:** Track MTTR via incident ticketing systems
- **Quarterly Reviews:** Review IR metrics quarterly; identify trends, improvement opportunities
- **Executive Reporting:** Report key metrics to executives, board (demonstrates IR maturity)

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**Emerging Insurer Interest:**

- Some cyber insurers request **MTTD/MTTR metrics** during policy renewal (demonstrates IR maturity)
- Organizations with mature IR metrics may receive **premium discounts**

**Faster Detection = Lower Costs:**

- **IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024:** Breaches detected in <200 days cost $1M less than breaches detected in 200+ days
- Insurers pay lower claims for organizations with fast detection, response

**Continuous Improvement:**

- IR metrics drive continuous improvement (reduce MTTD from 30 days to 5 days â†’ lower breach costs)
- Demonstrates organizational commitment to IR maturity

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**Long Detection Times:**

- **Average MTTD: 212 days** (IBM 2024)
- Attackers have 7+ months to exfiltrate data, deploy ransomware, cover tracks
- MTTD metrics drive investment in detection capabilities (SIEM, EDR, threat hunting)

**Dwell Time Reduction:**

- **Dwell time:** Time from initial compromise to detection
- Reducing dwell time from months to days/hours limits attacker impact

**Incident Response Maturity:**

- Organizations tracking MTTD/MTTR are in top quartile of IR maturity
- Metrics enable continuous improvement culture

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education (K-12/Higher Ed):**

- **Metrics Tracking:** Track MTTD for phishing incidents (via email security tools), ransomware, unauthorized access
- **Practical Implementation:** Simple spreadsheet tracking incident dates, detection dates, containment dates
- **SIEM Integration:** Higher ed institutions with SIEMs can automate MTTD tracking
- **Goal Setting:** Reduce MTTD from weeks to days over time

**Healthcare:**

- **Patient Safety Metrics:** Track MTTR for incidents affecting patient care (EHR downtime, medical device compromises)
- **HIPAA Breach Metrics:** Track time to HIPAA breach notification (60-day compliance)
- **24/7 Operations:** Healthcare requires fast MTTR (target <1 hour for critical incidents)
- **Continuous Monitoring:** SIEM integration for automated MTTD tracking

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Limited Resources:** Simple metrics tracking (spreadsheet); focus on high-impact incidents (ransomware, data breaches)
- **Quarterly Reviews:** Review IR metrics quarterly; identify patterns (e.g., phishing incidents increasing â†’ more training)
- **Donor Reporting:** Report IR metrics to board, major donors (demonstrates security stewardship)

**General Organizations:**

- **Enterprise IR Maturity:** Automated MTTD/MTTR tracking via SIEM, SOAR platforms
- **SOC Metrics:** 24/7 SOCs track MTTD/MTTR for all alerts, incidents
- **Industry Benchmarking:** Compare MTTD/MTTR to industry benchmarks (IBM, Verizon reports)
- **Compliance:** SOC 2, ISO 27001 increasingly expect IR metrics

**Citations:**

- **IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024:** Average MTTD 212 days; breaches detected <200 days cost $1M less
- **Veeam Ransomware Trends 2024:** Average ransomware recovery 21 days
- **NIST CSF 2.0:** DE.CM-7 (Monitoring for unauthorized personnel, connections, devices, and software is performed), RS.AN-6 (Actions performed during an investigation are recorded)
- CIS Controls v8: Control 8.11 (Conduct Reviews of Audit Logs)
- **SANS Incident Response Metrics:** Best practices for MTTD/MTTR tracking
