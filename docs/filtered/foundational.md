### Question 1.4: End-of-Life Software Management ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL

**Question Text:**
Has the organization identified and removed or isolated all software and operating systems that are end-of-life (no longer supported by the vendor)?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (Trust Requirement #1 for Education)

**Control Description:**

End-of-life (EOL) software is software that the vendor no longer supports with security patches or updates. Common examples:
- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server 2008/2012, Windows 7/8, macOS versions older than 3 years, Ubuntu LTS past support date
- **Applications:** Adobe Flash, Internet Explorer, older versions of Java, Microsoft Office 2010/2013
- **Databases:** SQL Server 2008, Oracle 11g, MySQL 5.5
- **Web Servers:** Apache 2.2, IIS 6.0

**EOL Software Management Process:**
1. **Discovery:** Identify all EOL software via software inventory (see Question 1.2)
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate business criticality and exposure (internet-facing vs. internal)
3. **Mitigation Options:**

    - **Upgrade:** Migrate to supported version (preferred)
    - **Replace:** Migrate to alternative supported software
    - **Isolate:** Network segmentation if immediate replacement impossible (temporary)

- **WannaCry ransomware (2017):** Exploited Windows XP/Server 2003 systems (EOL at time)
- **NotPetya (2017):** Similar exploitation of unsupported systems

Cyber insurance carriers:
- May **deny coverage** for breaches originating from EOL software (negligence)
- Require attestation that EOL software has been removed or isolated
- Some carriers offer reduced premiums for organizations with no EOL software

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **50% of perimeter vulnerabilities remain unpatched** (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- EOL software creates **permanent vulnerability** (patches will never be released)
- Attackers maintain exploit databases for EOL software (Windows XP, Server 2008)
- **Supply chain attacks:** Outdated web servers, databases enable attackers to compromise organizations

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**

## Category 2: Account Management and Access Control

### Overview

Account management and access control ensures that only authorized individuals can access organizational systems and data, with permissions appropriate to their role. This category addresses:
- User account lifecycle (creation, modification, deactivation)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all access points
- Privileged access management (PAM) for administrator accounts
- Password policies and credential management
- Access review and recertification processes

**Framework Alignment:**

- **NIST CSF 2.0:** PR.AC (Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control) - "Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users"
- **CIS Controls v8:** Control 5 (Account Management), Control 6 (Access Control Management)

### Importance

**Why Account Management Matters:**

1. **#1 Attack Vector:** Credential abuse is the most common initial access method (30% of incidents - IBM X-Force 2025)
2. **88% of Breaches:** Involve stolen or compromised credentials (Verizon DBIR 2024)
3. **Insurance Requirement:** 82% of cyber insurance claims involved organizations lacking MFA (Coalition 2024)
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers target privileged accounts for maximum impact (lateral movement, data exfiltration, ransomware deployment)
5. **Insider Threats:** Former employees with active accounts, excessive permissions, or shared credentials create risk

**Universal Threats:**

- **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use breached credentials from other sites to access organizational systems
- **Phishing:** Social engineering to trick users into revealing passwords or MFA codes
- **Brute Force:** Automated password guessing against accounts without MFA
- **Privilege Abuse:** Compromised privileged accounts enable ransomware deployment and data theft
- **Orphaned Accounts:** Former employee accounts remaining active after termination

**Sector-Specific Risks:**

- **Education:** Shared teacher accounts, student accounts not deactivated after graduation, summer staff turnover
- **Healthcare:** Shared clinical staff accounts, vendor/contractor accounts with excessive permissions, physicians using personal devices
- **Religious/Nonprofit:** Volunteer accounts with undefined lifecycle, shared passwords for ministry tools
- **General:** Contractor/vendor accounts, service accounts with static passwords, excessive administrative permissions

### Question 2.1: User Account Lifecycle Management

**Question Text:**
Does the organization have a formal process for user account creation, modification, and deactivation aligned with hiring, role changes, and termination?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

User account lifecycle management includes:

**Account Creation:**

- Formal request and approval process (manager authorization)
- Role-based access provisioning (access based on job function)
- Integration with HR onboarding process
- Account naming conventions and email address standards
- New user security training completion before account activation

**Account Modification:**

- Role change process (promotion, department transfer, contractor conversion)
- Access recertification when responsibilities change
- Temporary access elevation for projects (time-limited)
- Integration with HR change management

**Account Deactivation:**

- Termination procedures (disable account immediately upon notification)
- Resignation procedures (disable account on last day)
- Leave of absence procedures (temporary disable)
- Automated deactivation based on HR system integration
- Account deletion after retention period (30-90 days post-termination)

**Access Reviews:**

- Quarterly or annual review of active accounts
- Manager attestation of team member access appropriateness
- Removal of unused accounts (dormant >90 days)
- Shared account identification and elimination

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Orphaned accounts (former employees) are prime targets for attackers:
- No monitoring (former employee won't report suspicious activity)
- Often retain elevated permissions from last role
- Credential reuse (employee may use same password elsewhere that gets breached)

Cyber insurance claims frequently involve:
- Terminated employee accessing systems post-termination (data theft, sabotage)
- Contractor accounts persisting beyond project completion
- Shared accounts preventing accountability during incidents

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Insider Threats:** Disgruntled former employees with active accounts can access systems remotely
- **Credential Reuse:** Former employee credentials appear in breach databases; attackers try them against organizational systems
- **Verizon DBIR 2024:** Orphaned accounts and excessive permissions frequently exploited

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**

- **High Turnover:** Teachers, substitutes, student teachers, summer staff create frequent account changes
- **Student Accounts:** Graduating seniors, transferring students require systematic deactivation
- **Challenge:** Summer transitions (June-August) create account management backlog

**Healthcare:**

- **Clinical Staff Mobility:** Nurses, physicians rotating through departments require role-based access changes
- **Vendor/Contractor Access:** Medical device technicians, consultants need time-limited access
- **HIPAA:** Access controls and workforce clearinghouse procedures required (Â§164.308(a)(3))

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Volunteer Turnover:** High volunteer churn requires systematic account deactivation
- **Seasonal Staff:** Summer camps, holiday programs create temporary account needs
- **Challenge:** Limited HR infrastructure; manual account management

**Citations:**

- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.1 (Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Accounts)
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.2 (Use Unique Passwords)
- NIST CSF 2.0: PR.AC-1 (Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked)
- HIPAA Security Rule: Â§164.308(a)(3)(i) - Workforce clearance procedures

### Question 2.2: Password Policy

**Question Text:**
Does the organization enforce a password policy requiring minimum length, complexity, and regular password changes (or passphrase/password manager usage)?

**Impact Rating:** Moderate (3)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

Modern password policies align with NIST SP 800-63B guidance:

**Minimum Requirements:**

- **Length:** Minimum 12-15 characters (passphrases preferred over complexity rules)
- **Complexity:** No strict complexity requirements if length â‰¥15 characters; otherwise require uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- **Password Managers:** Encourage or require password manager usage for generating/storing unique passwords
- **Passphrases:** Allow spaces and long phrases (e.g., "coffee-morning-sunshine-24")

**What NOT to Require (Outdated Practices):**

- **NO forced periodic password changes** (causes users to make predictable changes: Password1 â†’ Password2)
- **NO password hints** (often reveal answers)
- **NO security questions** (easily guessable or publicly available answers)

**Best Practices:**

- **Breach Detection:** Check passwords against known breach databases (Have I Been Pwned API)
- **No Password Reuse:** Prevent users from reusing previous passwords
- **Account Lockout:** Temporary lockout after failed login attempts (5-10 attempts)
- **MFA Requirement:** Reduce password reliance through multi-factor authentication (see Questions 2.3-2.6)

**Technical Enforcement:**

- Active Directory Group Policy or Azure AD Password Protection
- Password filters or validators
- Self-service password reset with identity verification

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

While password policies alone are insufficient protection, they remain baseline security hygiene. Weak passwords combined with lack of MFA create critical vulnerability.

Insurers assess:
- Minimum password length requirements (8+ characters minimum, 12+ preferred)
- MFA implementation (far more critical than password policy)
- Password manager deployment for IT/admin staff

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use breached credentials from other sites; password reuse across sites is common
- **Brute Force:** Short, simple passwords vulnerable to automated guessing
- **Phishing:** Strong passwords still vulnerable to phishing; MFA is essential defense

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**

- **Challenge:** Students/teachers resist complex passwords; password manager training needed
- **Student Accounts:** Age-appropriate password policies (elementary vs. high school)
- **FERPA:** Passwords protect access to student education records

**Healthcare:**

- **Challenge:** Clinical staff need rapid access during patient care; complex passwords slow workflow
- **HIPAA 2025 Security Rule:** Enhanced password requirements expected in final rule
- **Solution:** Biometric authentication or badge readers combined with PIN

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Challenge:** Older volunteers/congregation members unfamiliar with password managers
- **Solution:** Passphrase approach (memorable but long)

**Citations:**

- **NIST SP 800-63B:** Digital Identity Guidelines (modern password guidance)
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.2 (Use Unique Passwords)
- NIST CSF 2.0: PR.AC-1 (Credentials are managed)
- HIPAA Security Rule: Â§164.308(a)(5)(ii)(D) - Password management

### Question 2.7: Privileged Account Separation

**Question Text:**
Are privileged administrative functions performed using dedicated administrative accounts (not regular user accounts)?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** NO (Comprehensive maturity indicator)

**Control Description:**

Privileged account separation means:
- **Separate Accounts:** Administrators have TWO accounts:
  - **Regular User Account:** For email, web browsing, daily work (john.smith@org.edu)
  - **Admin Account:** For administrative tasks only (john.smith-admin@org.edu or admin-jsmith)
- **No Dual-Use Accounts:** Never use admin account for email, web browsing, or daily tasks
- **Elevated Access Only When Needed:** Admin account used only for administrative tasks, then logged out

**Implementation:**

- Active Directory: Separate OU for admin accounts with restrictive GPOs
- Azure AD: Separate admin accounts or Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time admin access
- Workstation Restriction: Admin accounts cannot log into regular workstations (only jump servers/admin workstations)

**Rationale:**

- **Phishing Protection:** Admin account not used for email, so cannot be phished
- **Malware Protection:** Admin account not used for web browsing, so malware cannot compromise admin credentials
- **Audit Trail:** Clear separation of administrative actions vs. regular user activity

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Privileged account separation is core component of **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**:
- BeyondTrust: "Removing admin rights from workstations" is basic requirement of cyber insurers
- Prevents **privilege escalation** attacks where malware on user workstation compromises admin credentials

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- Dual-use admin accounts create **phishing vulnerability**: Admin clicks malicious email link â†’ malware runs with admin privileges
- **Pass-the-Hash Attacks:** Malware on workstation steals cached admin credentials
- **Lateral Movement:** Compromised admin account on one system enables lateral movement across network

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**

- **Small IT Teams:** 1-3 IT staff often use personal email accounts as admin accounts
- **Best Practice:** Separate admin account even for small teams

**Healthcare:**

- **EHR Administrators:** Separate account for EHR admin tasks vs. clinical documentation
- **HIPAA:** Administrative access should be separate from clinical access for audit purposes

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Volunteer IT:** Separate admin account from personal volunteer account

**Citations:**

- **BeyondTrust:** "Removing admin rights and enforcing PoLP" basic insurance requirement
- CIS Controls v8: Control 5.4 (Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Accounts)
- NIST CSF 2.0: PR.AC-4 (Access permissions are managed)
- Microsoft Security Baseline: Separate admin accounts recommended

- **Role Change Reviews:** Immediate review when employee changes roles, promoted, or transfers departments
- **Privileged Access Reviews:** Quarterly review of all administrative accounts
- **Shared Account Audit:** Identify and eliminate shared accounts
- **Dormant Account Removal:** Disable accounts inactive >90 days

**Review Process:**
1. Generate access reports from systems (Active Directory, cloud services, applications)
2. Distribute to department managers for review
3. Managers certify access is appropriate or request changes
4. IT implements approved changes (remove excessive permissions)
5. Document reviews for compliance audit trail

**Automated Tools:**

- **Identity Governance:** Tools like SailPoint, Okta Identity Governance automate access reviews
- **Azure AD Access Reviews:** Built-in access review workflows for Microsoft 365
- **Manual Reviews:** Excel spreadsheets for smaller organizations

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Access creep (accumulation of permissions over time) creates risk:
- Employees retain permissions from previous roles
- Excessive permissions enable insider threats or account compromise
- Demonstrates governance maturity to insurers

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **Insider Threats:** Disgruntled employees with excessive permissions can cause significant damage
- **Compromised Accounts:** Attackers with access to over-privileged account have larger impact
- **Compliance:** SOX, HIPAA, FERPA require periodic access reviews

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education:**

- **Teacher Role Changes:** Teacher moves from elementary to high school, access should change
- **Student Graduation:** Annual review identifies graduated students with active accounts

**Healthcare:**

- **HIPAA:** Access reviews required under Security Rule (Â§164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C))

## Category 3: Data Protection and Privacy

### Overview

Data protection and privacy controls safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. This category addresses:
- Data inventory and classification
- Encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Data retention and secure deletion
- Privileged access management (PAM)
- Privacy compliance (FERPA, HIPAA, state privacy laws)
- Data loss prevention

**Framework Alignment:**

- **NIST CSF 2.0:** PR.DS (Data Security) - "Data is managed consistent with the organization's risk strategy"
- **CIS Controls v8:** Control 3 (Data Protection)

### Importance

**Why Data Protection Matters:**

1. **Breach Notification Laws:** All 50 states + DC require notification of data breaches involving PII
2. **Regulatory Fines:** HIPAA violations ($50K-$1.5M per violation), FERPA (loss of federal funding), state privacy laws ($7,500 per violation)
3. **Cyber Insurance Coverage:** First-party breach costs (notification, credit monitoring, legal defense) are primary coverage
4. **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches erode trust with students/patients/donors/customers
5. **Privilege Escalation:** Compromised privileged accounts enable attackers to access ALL organizational data

**Universal Threats:**

- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data, demands payment for decryption key
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers steal sensitive data for sale on dark web or extortion
- **Insider Threats:** Employees with excessive access steal data before departure
- **Cloud Misconfiguration:** Publicly exposed cloud storage (S3 buckets, Azure blobs)
- **Unencrypted Data:** Laptops, USB drives, backups lost or stolen without encryption

**Sector-Specific Risks:**

### Question 5.5: Email Authentication Protocols (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Has the organization implemented email authentication protocols including SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to prevent email spoofing and impersonation attacks?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Email authentication protocols work together to prevent domain spoofing and verify email legitimacy:

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**

- **Purpose:** Authorizes specific IP addresses to send email from your domain
- **DNS Record:** Publish SPF record listing authorized mail servers
- **Example:** "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all" (Google Workspace)

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**

- **Purpose:** Adds digital signature to verify message hasn't been tampered with in transit
- **Implementation:** Enable DKIM signing on outbound email server
- **Verification:** Receiving server checks signature against public key in DNS

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):**

- **Purpose:** Provides policy for handling emails failing SPF/DKIM checks + generates reports
- **Policies:**
  - **p=none:** Monitor mode (collect reports, no enforcement)
  - **p=quarantine:** Failed emails go to spam folder
  - **p=reject:** Failed emails rejected entirely (strongest protection)
- **Reports:** Daily XML reports showing email authentication results, spoofing attempts

**Full Implementation:**
1. **Publish SPF record** in DNS listing authorized mail servers
2. **Enable DKIM signing** on outbound email (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 admin consoles)
3. **Implement DMARC policy** starting with p=none for monitoring
4. **Monitor DMARC reports** to identify legitimate senders and spoofing attempts
5. **Strengthen DMARC to p=quarantine or p=reject** after validation period

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Email remains **#1 attack vector** with phishing as top initial access method across all sectors:

**Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks:**

- Cost billions annually
- Attackers impersonate executives, administrators, or vendors to request wire transfers or credential disclosure
- Email authentication prevents domain impersonation (attacker can't send email appearing to be from your domain)

**Coalition Cyber Insurance:**

- Specifically lists **email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)** on cyber insurance coverage checklist
- Many BEC losses are excluded or sub-limited in cyber policies, making **prevention critical**

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**IBM X-Force 2025:**

- **84% uptick in phishing emails** delivering infostealers
- Attackers increasingly use domain impersonation to appear legitimate

**Verizon DBIR 2024:**

## Category 9: Incident Response and Recovery

**Overview:**

Incident response and recovery capabilities enable organizations to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents effectively. Despite best preventive efforts, security incidents will occur - mature incident response processes minimize damage, reduce recovery time, and ensure compliance with breach notification requirements.

**Importance:**

**Inevitable Security Incidents:**

- **68% of organizations experience material cybersecurity incidents** annually (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- **Average breach detection time: 212 days** (IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024)
- **Average recovery time: 21 days** for ransomware without tested IR plan (Veeam 2024)
- Organizations with IR plans recover 3-5x faster than those without

**Insurance Requirements:**

- Cyber insurers **require documented incident response plans** for coverage
- **Incident response testing** (tabletop exercises) increasingly required
- **Cyber insurance coverage** itself is becoming a recommended control
- Breach notification deadlines (HIPAA 60 days, state laws 30-90 days) require rapid IR

**Sector-Agnostic Relevance:**

- **All sectors** experience cybersecurity incidents (phishing, ransomware, data breaches)
- IR applies universally across Education, Healthcare, Religious/Nonprofit, General organizations
- **Regulatory compliance** (HIPAA, state privacy laws, FERPA) requires breach response capabilities

**Category 9 includes 7 questions:**

- Question 9.1: Incident Response Plan
- Question 9.2: Incident Response Team
- Question 9.3: Incident Response Testing
- Question 9.4: Tabletop Exercises
- Question 9.5: Cyber Insurance Coverage
