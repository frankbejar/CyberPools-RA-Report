- **Databases:** SQL Server 2008, Oracle 11g, MySQL 5.5
- **Web Servers:** Apache 2.2, IIS 6.0

**EOL Software Management Process:**

1. **Discovery:** Identify all EOL software via software inventory (see Question 1.2)
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate business criticality and exposure (internet-facing vs. internal)
3. **Mitigation Options:**

    - **Upgrade:** Migrate to supported version (preferred)
    - **Replace:** Migrate to alternative supported software
    - **Isolate:** Network segmentation if immediate replacement impossible (temporary)
    - **Decommission:** Turn off if no longer needed
4. **Timeline:** Establish upgrade/replacement timeline (typically 6-12 months)
5. **Exceptions:** Document exceptions with compensating controls (air-gapped systems, vendor-managed medical devices)

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**Critical Insurance Concern:**

- EOL software has **known, unpatched vulnerabilities** that attackers actively exploit
- **WannaCry ransomware (2017):** Exploited Windows XP/Server 2003 systems (EOL at time)
- **NotPetya (2017):** Similar exploitation of unsupported systems

Cyber insurance carriers:

- May **deny coverage** for breaches originating from EOL software (negligence)
- Require attestation that EOL software has been removed or isolated
- Some carriers offer reduced premiums for organizations with no EOL software

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **50% of perimeter vulnerabilities remain unpatched** (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- EOL software creates **permanent vulnerability** (patches will never be released)
- Attackers maintain exploit databases for EOL software (Windows XP, Server 2008)

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Email authentication protocols work together to prevent domain spoofing and verify email legitimacy:

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**

- **Purpose:** Authorizes specific IP addresses to send email from your domain
- **DNS Record:** Publish SPF record listing authorized mail servers
- **Example:** "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all" (Google Workspace)

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**

- **Purpose:** Adds digital signature to verify message hasn't been tampered with in transit
- **Implementation:** Enable DKIM signing on outbound email server
- **Verification:** Receiving server checks signature against public key in DNS

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):**

- **Purpose:** Provides policy for handling emails failing SPF/DKIM checks + generates reports
- **Policies:**

  - **p=none:** Monitor mode (collect reports, no enforcement)
  - **p=quarantine:** Failed emails go to spam folder
  - **p=reject:** Failed emails rejected entirely (strongest protection)
- **Reports:** Daily XML reports showing email authentication results, spoofing attempts

**Full Implementation:**

1. **Publish SPF record** in DNS listing authorized mail servers
2. **Enable DKIM signing** on outbound email (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 admin consoles)
3. **Implement DMARC policy** starting with p=none for monitoring
