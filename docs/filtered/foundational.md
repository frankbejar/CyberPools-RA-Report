### Question 1.4: End-of-Life Software Management ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL

**Question Text:**
Has the organization identified and removed or isolated all software and operating systems that are end-of-life (no longer supported by the vendor)?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (Trust Requirement #1 for Education)

**Control Description:**

End-of-life (EOL) software is software that the vendor no longer supports with security patches or updates. Common examples:

- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server 2008/2012, Windows 7/8, macOS versions older than 3 years, Ubuntu LTS past support date
- **Applications:** Adobe Flash, Internet Explorer, older versions of Java, Microsoft Office 2010/2013
- **Databases:** SQL Server 2008, Oracle 11g, MySQL 5.5
- **Web Servers:** Apache 2.2, IIS 6.0

**EOL Software Management Process:**

1. **Discovery:** Identify all EOL software via software inventory (see Question 1.2)
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate business criticality and exposure (internet-facing vs. internal)
3. **Mitigation Options:**

    - **Upgrade:** Migrate to supported version (preferred)
    - **Replace:** Migrate to alternative supported software
    - **Isolate:** Network segmentation if immediate replacement impossible (temporary)
    - **Decommission:** Turn off if no longer needed
4. **Timeline:** Establish upgrade/replacement timeline (typically 6-12 months)
5. **Exceptions:** Document exceptions with compensating controls (air-gapped systems, vendor-managed medical devices)

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**Critical Insurance Concern:**

- EOL software has **known, unpatched vulnerabilities** that attackers actively exploit
- **WannaCry ransomware (2017):** Exploited Windows XP/Server 2003 systems (EOL at time)
- **NotPetya (2017):** Similar exploitation of unsupported systems

Cyber insurance carriers:

- May **deny coverage** for breaches originating from EOL software (negligence)
- Require attestation that EOL software has been removed or isolated
- Some carriers offer reduced premiums for organizations with no EOL software

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

- **50% of perimeter vulnerabilities remain unpatched** (Verizon DBIR 2024)
- EOL software creates **permanent vulnerability** (patches will never be released)
- Attackers maintain exploit databases for EOL software (Windows XP, Server 2008)
- **Supply chain attacks:** Outdated web servers, databases enable attackers to compromise organizations

**Sector-Specific Context:**

### Question 3.5: Privileged Access Management (PAM) ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Does your organization implement controls to manage and monitor privileged/administrative accounts?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Privileged Access Management (PAM) is the practice of managing and monitoring privileged/administrative accounts that have elevated permissions to access critical systems and data. **This is fundamentally a process and policy discipline, not a product requirement.** Organizations can meet this foundational control through documented processes and procedures.

**Why PAM is Foundational:**

Privileged accounts (domain administrators, SIS administrators, network administrators) are the #1 target in ransomware attacks. Unmanaged privileged access is a leading cause of insurance claim denials and coverage limitations.

**Minimum Foundational Requirements:**

Organizations must demonstrate active management of privileged accounts through documented processes and controls:

- **Inventory of Privileged Accounts:** Maintain list of all accounts with administrative privileges (domain admins, SIS admins, network admins, service accounts)
- **Separate Privileged Accounts:** IT staff use separate accounts for privileged activities (admin accounts not used for email/web browsing)
- **Regular Reviews:** Conduct reviews of who has privileged access (at least quarterly)
- **No Shared Credentials:** Eliminate shared/generic administrator credentials
- **Approval Process:** Document process for requesting and approving elevated privileges
- **Activity Logging:** Log and review privileged account activity

**PAM Implementation Approaches (Tiered):**

**TIER 1: Process-Based PAM**

**This approach satisfies the foundational requirement using documented processes:**

- Manual tracking of privileged accounts via spreadsheet or documentation system
- Scheduled calendar reminders for quarterly privileged access reviews
- Written procedures for requesting, approving, and revoking admin access
- Regular audits using native Active Directory/Azure AD tools
- Separation of privileged and standard accounts (separate admin accounts for IT staff)
- **Best for:** Small to medium organizations, limited IT staff
- **Time investment:** 2-4 hours per quarter
- **Technology required:** Existing Active Directory/Azure AD admin tools

**TIER 2: Tool-Assisted PAM**

**Basic tools to enhance process-based PAM:**

- **Password Vault:** Store shared service account credentials securely (KeePass, BitWarden, 1Password)
- **Privileged Access Logging:** Centralized logging and monitoring of admin activities
- **Automated Alerts:** Notifications for privileged account changes or suspicious activity
- **Account Discovery:** Automated tools to find privileged accounts across environment
- **Best for:** Medium organizations (5,000-20,000 users/students)
- **Examples:** BitWarden Teams, JumpCloud, Active Directory Premium, Keeper Business

**TIER 3: Enterprise PAM Platform**

**Dedicated PAM solutions with advanced capabilities:**

- **Credential Vaulting:** Centralized repository for all privileged credentials
- **Session Recording:** Video recording and keystroke logging of privileged sessions
- **Just-In-Time Access:** Time-limited privilege elevation with automatic revocation
- **Automated Password Rotation:** Regular automated credential changes for service accounts
- **Privilege Analytics:** Behavioral analytics to detect anomalous privileged account usage
- **Best for:** Large organizations (>20,000 users/students), high-security requirements
- **Examples:** CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Delinea, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, AWS Secrets Manager

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

**RAPID INSURANCE REQUIREMENT GROWTH:**

- **42% of organizations in 2024** required to have PAM for cyber insurance coverage (up from 36% in 2023) - Securden
- **Vast majority of cyberattacks** involve stolen credentials and misuse of privileged access - ManageEngine
- Organizations lacking robust PAM strategies face **policy rejection or cancellation**

**Insurer PAM Requirements:**

- **Removing local admin rights** from workstations - BeyondTrust
- **Enforcing principle of least privilege (PoLP)** - BeyondTrust
- **Consolidating and securing all privileged credentials** - Securden
- **Monitoring and recording privileged sessions** - ManageEngine
- **Auditing all privileged activities** with real-time alerts - Securden

Many insurers now mandate proof of adherence to regulatory standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) which require PAM controls.

**Threat Landscape Justification:**

**IBM X-Force 2025:**

- **Account abuse remains #1 initial access vector** (30% of incidents across all sectors)
- Attackers specifically target privileged accounts for maximum impact
- Privileged accounts enable lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment

**Verizon DBIR 2024:**

- **88% of breaches involved stolen credentials** (universal across industries)
- Privileged accounts with elevated permissions are prime targets
- Can modify systems, access ALL data, disable security controls (EDR, SIEM, backups)

**Sector-Specific Context:**

**Education (K-12/Higher Ed):**

- **Shared Admin Credentials:** IT staff often share admin credentials across team
- **Service Accounts:** Student information systems (SIS), learning management systems (LMS) use service accounts with weak oversight
- **Limited Visibility:** Lack visibility into privileged activities - who accessed student database when?
- **Practical Implementation:** Cloud-based PAM (Delinea Secret Server Cloud) with EDU pricing
- **FERPA Compliance:** PAM provides accountability for who accessed student education records

**Healthcare:**

- **Hospital IT Shares Admin Credentials:** EHR systems (Epic, Cerner) often have shared admin passwords
- **Service Accounts:** Medical devices, lab systems, pharmacy systems use service accounts
- **HIPAA 2025 Security Rule:** Enhanced access controls required for ePHI systems
- **Compliance:** HIPAA Security Rule Â§164.312(a)(1) - access controls and audit controls require PAM
- **Practical Implementation:** PAM integrated with Active Directory for Windows-based EHR environments

**Religious/Nonprofit:**

- **Small IT Teams / Volunteers:** Often share admin passwords for donor systems, financial software
- **Limited Expertise:** Makes PAM especially valuable - managed service options available
- **Service Accounts:** Church management systems, donor databases use service accounts with static passwords
- **Practical Implementation:** Managed PAM services (Arctic Wolf, Huntress) handle deployment/operation

**General Organizations:**

- **Admin Access:** Financial systems, payroll, HR databases require privileged access
- **Service Accounts:** Active Directory, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), infrastructure automation
- **Compliance:** SOX (if applicable), state data breach notification laws, industry regulations

### Question 5.5: Email Authentication Protocols (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) ðŸ”‘ FOUNDATIONAL ðŸ†•

**Question Text:**
Has the organization implemented email authentication protocols including SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to prevent email spoofing and impersonation attacks?

**Impact Rating:** High (5)

**Foundational:** ðŸ”‘ YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)

**Control Description:**

Email authentication protocols work together to prevent domain spoofing and verify email legitimacy:

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**

- **Purpose:** Authorizes specific IP addresses to send email from your domain
- **DNS Record:** Publish SPF record listing authorized mail servers
- **Example:** "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all" (Google Workspace)

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**

- **Purpose:** Adds digital signature to verify message hasn't been tampered with in transit
- **Implementation:** Enable DKIM signing on outbound email server
- **Verification:** Receiving server checks signature against public key in DNS

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):**

- **Purpose:** Provides policy for handling emails failing SPF/DKIM checks + generates reports
- **Policies:**

  - **p=none:** Monitor mode (collect reports, no enforcement)
  - **p=quarantine:** Failed emails go to spam folder
  - **p=reject:** Failed emails rejected entirely (strongest protection)
- **Reports:** Daily XML reports showing email authentication results, spoofing attempts

**Full Implementation:**

1. **Publish SPF record** in DNS listing authorized mail servers
2. **Enable DKIM signing** on outbound email (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 admin consoles)
3. **Implement DMARC policy** starting with p=none for monitoring
4. **Monitor DMARC reports** to identify legitimate senders and spoofing attempts
5. **Strengthen DMARC to p=quarantine or p=reject** after validation period

**Insurance Rationale (Universal):**

Email remains **#1 attack vector** with phishing as top initial access method across all sectors:

**Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks:**
