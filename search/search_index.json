Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)</p> <p>Control Description:</p> <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is the practice of managing and monitoring privileged/administrative accounts that have elevated permissions to access critical systems and data. This is fundamentally a process and policy discipline, not a product requirement. Organizations can meet this foundational control through documented processes and procedures.</p> <p>Why PAM is Foundational:</p> <p>Privileged accounts (domain administrators, SIS administrators, network administrators) are the #1 target in ransomware attacks. Unmanaged privileged access is a leading cause of insurance claim denials and coverage limitations.</p> <p>Minimum Foundational Requirements:</p> <p>Organizations must demonstrate active management of privileged accounts through documented processes and controls:</p> <ul> <li>Inventory of Privileged Accounts: Maintain list of all accounts with administrative privileges (domain admins, SIS admins, network admins, service accounts)</li> <li>Separate Privileged Accounts: IT staff use separate accounts for privileged activities (admin accounts not used for email/web browsing)</li> <li>Regular Reviews: Conduct reviews of who has privileged access (at least quarterly)</li> <li>No Shared Credentials: Eliminate shared/generic administrator credentials</li> <li>Approval Process: Document process for requesting and approving elevated privileges</li> <li>Activity Logging: Log and review privileged account activity</li> </ul> <p>PAM Implementation Approaches (Tiered):</p> <p>TIER 1: Process-Based PAM</p> <p>This approach satisfies the foundational requirement using documented processes:</p> <ul> <li>Manual tracking of privileged accounts via spreadsheet or documentation system</li> <li>Scheduled calendar reminders for quarterly privileged access reviews</li> <li>Written procedures for requesting, approving, and revoking admin access</li> <li>Regular audits using native Active Directory/Azure AD tools</li> <li>Separation of privileged and standard accounts (separate admin accounts for IT staff)</li> <li>Best for: Small to medium organizations, limited IT staff</li> <li>Time investment: 2-4 hours per quarter</li> <li>Technology required: Existing Active Directory/Azure AD admin tools</li> </ul> <p>TIER 2: Tool-Assisted PAM</p> <p>Basic tools to enhance process-based PAM:</p> <ul> <li>Password Vault: Store shared service account credentials securely (KeePass, BitWarden, 1Password)</li> <li>Privileged Access Logging: Centralized logging and monitoring of admin activities</li> <li>Automated Alerts: Notifications for privileged account changes or suspicious activity</li> <li>Account Discovery: Automated tools to find privileged accounts across environment</li> <li>Best for: Medium organizations (5,000-20,000 users/students)</li> <li>Examples: BitWarden Teams, JumpCloud, Active Directory Premium, Keeper Business</li> </ul> <p>TIER 3: Enterprise PAM Platform</p> <p>Dedicated PAM solutions with advanced capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Credential Vaulting: Centralized repository for all privileged credentials</li> <li>Session Recording: Video recording and keystroke logging of privileged sessions</li> <li>Just-In-Time Access: Time-limited privilege elevation with automatic revocation</li> <li>Automated Password Rotation: Regular automated credential changes for service accounts</li> <li>Privilege Analytics: Behavioral analytics to detect anomalous privileged account usage</li> <li>Best for: Large organizations (&gt;20,000 users/students), high-security requirements</li> <li>Examples: CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Delinea, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, AWS Secrets Manager</li> </ul> <p>Insurance Rationale (Universal):</p> <p>RAPID INSURANCE REQUIREMENT GROWTH:</p> <ul> <li>42% of organizations in 2024 required to have PAM for cyber insurance coverage (up from 36% in 2023) -

Key metrics include:</p> <p>Key IR Metrics:</p> <ul> <li>Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): Average time from incident occurrence to detection</li> <li>Industry Average: 212 days (IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024)</li> <li> <p>Target: &lt;24 hours for mature organizations</p> </li> <li> <p>Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): Average time from detection to containment</p> </li> <li> <p>Target: &lt;1 hour for

plan</li> </ul> <p>Additional IR Metrics:</p> <ul> <li>Incident Count: Number of incidents by type, severity</li> <li>False Positive Rate: SIEM alerts requiring investigation vs. true incidents</li> <li>Escalation Time: Time to escalate incidents to IR team, executives</li> <li>Breach Notification Compliance: % of breaches notified within legal deadlines</li> </ul> <p>Metrics Tracking:</p> <ul> <li>SIEM/Security Tools: Automated MTTD tracking via SIEM alert timestamps</li> <li>Incident Tickets: Track MTTR via incident ticketing systems</li> <li>Quarterly Reviews: Review IR metrics quarterly; identify trends, improvement opportunities</li> <li>Executive Reporting: Report key metrics to executives, board (demonstrates IR maturity)</li> </ul> <p>Insurance Rationale (Universal):</p> <p>Emerging Insurer Interest:</p> <ul> <li>Some cyber insurers request MTTD/MTTR metrics during policy renewal (demonstrates IR maturity)</li> <li>Organizations with mature IR metrics may receive premium discounts</li> </ul> <p>Faster Detection = Lower Costs:</p> <ul> <li>IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024: Breaches detected in &lt;200 days cost $1M less than breaches detected in 200+ days</li> <li>Insurers pay lower claims for organizations with fast detection, response</li> </ul> <p>Continuous Improvement:</p> <ul> <li>IR metrics drive continuous improvement (reduce MTTD from 30 days to 5 days \u2192 lower breach costs)</li> <li>Demonstrates organizational commitment to IR maturity</li> </ul> <p>Threat Landscape Justification:</p> <p>Long Detection Times:</p> <ul> <li>Average MTTD: 212 days (IBM 2024)</li> <li>Attackers have 7+ months to exfiltrate data, deploy ransomware, cover tracks</li> <li>MTTD metrics drive investment in detection capabilities (SIEM, EDR, threat hunting)</li> </ul> <p>Dwell Time Reduction:</p> <ul> <li>Dwell time: Time from initial compromise to detection</li> <li>Reducing dwell time from months to days/hours limits attacker impact</li> </ul> <p>Incident Response Maturity:</p> <ul> <li>Organizations tracking MTTD/MTTR are in top quartile of IR maturity</li> <li>Metrics enable continuous improvement culture</li> </ul> <p>Sector-Specific Context:</p> <p>Education (K-12/Higher Ed):</p> <ul> <li>Metrics Tracking: Track MTTD for phishing incidents (via email security tools), ransomware, unauthorized access</li> <li>Practical Implementation: Simple spreadsheet tracking incident dates, detection dates, containment dates</li> <li>SIEM Integration: Higher ed institutions with SIEMs can automate MTTD tracking</li> <li>Goal Setting: Reduce MTTD from weeks to days over time</li> </ul> <p>Healthcare:</p> <ul> <li>Patient Safety Metrics: Track MTTR for incidents affecting patient care (EHR downtime, medical device compromises)</li> <li>HIPAA Breach Metrics: Track time to HIPAA breach notification (60-day compliance)</li> <li>24/7 Operations: Healthcare requires fast MTTR (target &lt;1 hour for critical incidents)</li> <li>Continuous Monitoring: SIEM integration for automated MTTD tracking</li> </ul> <p>Religious/Nonprofit:</p> <ul> <li>Limited Resources: Simple metrics tracking (spreadsheet); focus on high-impact incidents (ransomware, data breaches)</li> <li>Quarterly Reviews: Review IR metrics quarterly; identify patterns (e.g., phishing incidents increasing \u2192 more training)</li> <li>Donor Reporting: Report IR metrics to board,

\ud83d\udd11 YES - Insurance Critical (NEW 2026)</p> <p>Control Description:</p> <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is the practice of managing and monitoring privileged/administrative accounts that have elevated permissions to access critical systems and data. This is fundamentally a process and policy discipline, not a product requirement. Organizations can meet this foundational control through documented processes and procedures.</p> <p>Why PAM is Foundational:</p> <p>Privileged accounts (domain administrators, SIS administrators, network administrators) are the #1 target in ransomware attacks. Unmanaged privileged access is a leading cause of insurance claim denials and coverage limitations.</p> <p>Minimum Foundational Requirements:</p> <p>Organizations must demonstrate active management of privileged accounts through documented processes and controls:</p> <ul> <li>Inventory of Privileged Accounts: Maintain list of all accounts with administrative privileges (domain admins, SIS admins, network admins, service accounts)</li> <li>Separate Privileged Accounts: IT staff use separate accounts for privileged activities (admin accounts not used for email/web browsing)</li> <li>Regular Reviews: Conduct reviews of who has privileged access (at least quarterly)</li> <li>No Shared Credentials: Eliminate shared/generic administrator credentials</li> <li>Approval Process: Document process for requesting and approving elevated privileges</li> <li>Activity Logging: Log and review privileged account activity</li> </ul> <p>PAM Implementation Approaches (Tiered):</p> <p>TIER 1: Process-Based PAM</p> <p>This approach satisfies the foundational requirement using documented processes:</p> <ul> <li>Manual tracking of privileged accounts via spreadsheet or documentation system</li> <li>Scheduled calendar reminders for quarterly privileged access reviews</li> <li>Written procedures for requesting, approving, and revoking admin access</li> <li>Regular audits using native Active Directory/Azure AD tools</li> <li>Separation of privileged and standard accounts (separate admin accounts for IT staff)</li> <li>Best for: Small to medium organizations, limited IT staff</li> <li>Time investment: 2-4 hours per quarter</li> <li>Technology required: Existing Active Directory/Azure AD admin tools</li> </ul> <p>TIER 2: Tool-Assisted PAM</p> <p>Basic tools to enhance process-based PAM:</p> <ul> <li>Password Vault: Store shared service account credentials securely (KeePass, BitWarden, 1Password)</li> <li>Privileged Access Logging: Centralized logging and monitoring of admin activities</li> <li>Automated Alerts: Notifications for privileged account changes or suspicious activity</li> <li>Account Discovery: Automated tools to find privileged accounts across environment</li> <li>Best for: Medium organizations (5,000-20,000 users/students)</li> <li>Examples: BitWarden Teams, JumpCloud, Active Directory Premium, Keeper Business</li> </ul> <p>TIER 3: Enterprise PAM Platform</p> <p>Dedicated PAM solutions with advanced capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Credential Vaulting: Centralized repository for all privileged credentials</li> <li>Session Recording: Video recording and keystroke logging of privileged sessions</li> <li>Just-In-Time Access: Time-limited privilege elevation with automatic revocation</li> <li>Automated Password Rotation: Regular automated credential changes for service accounts</li> <li>Privilege Analytics: Behavioral analytics to detect anomalous privileged account usage</li> <li>Best for: Large organizations (&gt;20,000 users/students), high-security requirements</li> <li>Examples: CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Delinea, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, AWS Secrets Manager</li> </ul> <p>Insurance Rationale (Universal):</p> <p>RAPID INSURANCE REQUIREMENT GROWTH:</p> <ul> <li>42% of organizations in 2024 required to have PAM for cyber insurance coverage (up from 36% in 2023) -

identify trends, improvement opportunities</li> <li>Executive Reporting: Report key metrics to executives, board (demonstrates IR maturity)</li> </ul> <p>Insurance Rationale (Universal):</p> <p>Emerging Insurer Interest:</p> <ul> <li>Some cyber insurers request MTTD/MTTR metrics during policy renewal (demonstrates IR maturity)</li> <li>Organizations with mature IR metrics may receive premium discounts</li> </ul> <p>Faster Detection = Lower Costs:</p> <ul> <li>IBM Cost of Data Breach 2024: Breaches detected in &lt;200 days cost $1M less than breaches detected in 200+ days</li> <li>Insurers pay lower claims for organizations with fast detection, response</li> </ul> <p>Continuous Improvement:</p> <ul> <li>IR metrics drive continuous improvement (reduce MTTD from 30 days to 5 days \u2192 lower breach costs)</li> <li>Demonstrates organizational commitment to IR maturity</li> </ul> <p>Threat Landscape Justification:</p> <p>Long Detection Times:</p> <ul> <li>Average MTTD: 212 days (IBM 2024)</li> <li>Attackers have 7+ months to exfiltrate data, deploy ransomware, cover tracks</li> <li>MTTD metrics drive investment in detection capabilities (SIEM, EDR, threat hunting)</li> </ul> <p>Dwell Time Reduction:</p> <ul> <li>Dwell time: Time from initial compromise to detection</li> <li>Reducing dwell time from months to days/hours limits attacker impact</li> </ul> <p>Incident Response Maturity:</p> <ul> <li>Organizations tracking MTTD/MTTR are in top quartile of IR maturity</li> <li>Metrics enable continuous improvement culture</li> </ul> <p>Sector-Specific Context:</p> <p>Education (K-12/Higher Ed):</p> <ul> <li>Metrics Tracking: Track MTTD for phishing incidents (via email security tools), ransomware, unauthorized access</li> <li>Practical Implementation: Simple spreadsheet tracking incident dates, detection dates, containment dates</li> <li>SIEM Integration: Higher ed institutions with SIEMs can automate MTTD tracking</li> <li>Goal Setting: Reduce MTTD from weeks to days over time</li> </ul> <p>Healthcare:</p> <ul> <li>Patient Safety Metrics: Track MTTR for incidents affecting patient care (EHR downtime, medical device compromises)</li> <li>HIPAA Breach Metrics: Track time to HIPAA breach notification (60-day compliance)</li> <li>24/7 Operations: Healthcare requires fast MTTR (target &lt;1 hour for critical incidents)</li> <li>Continuous Monitoring: SIEM integration for automated MTTD tracking</li> </ul> <p>Religious/Nonprofit:</p> <ul> <li>Limited Resources: Simple metrics tracking (spreadsheet); focus on high-impact incidents (ransomware, data breaches)</li> <li>Quarterly Reviews: Review IR metrics quarterly; identify patterns (e.g., phishing incidents increasing \u2192 more training)</li> <li>Donor Reporting: Report IR metrics to board, major donors (demonstrates security stewardship)</li> </ul> <p>General Organizations:</p> <ul> <li>Enterprise IR Maturity: Automated MTTD/MTTR tracking via SIEM, SOAR platforms</li> <li>SOC Metrics: 24/7 SOCs track MTTD/MTTR for all alerts, incidents</li> <li>Industry Benchmarking: Compare MTTD/MTTR to industry benchmarks (IBM, Verizon reports)</li> <li>Compliance: SOC 2, ISO 27001 increasingly
