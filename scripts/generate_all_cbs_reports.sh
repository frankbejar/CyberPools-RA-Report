The school demonstrates strong practices in **data recovery**, **secure network configuration**, **account management**, and **inventory management**. However, critical vulnerabilities remain in three key areas: **Incident Response**, **Data Protection**, and **Endpoint Security**. Specifically, the absence of a **formal Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP)**, lack of **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**, and missing encryption on endpoints, servers, and backups present significant risks. Addressing these gaps by implementing a CIRP, deploying EDR, and encrypting all critical systems will substantially enhance the school's cyber resilience and incident response capabilities." \

The school demonstrates strong practices in **data recovery**, **multi-factor authentication enforcement**, and **network segmentation**. However, major vulnerabilities exist in **Incident Response**, **Endpoint Security**, and **Security Awareness**. Specifically, the absence of a **formal Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP)**, lack of **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**, missing endpoint encryption, inconsistent security awareness training, and gaps in backup testing present elevated risks to detection, response, and recovery capabilities. Strengthening these areas by implementing a CIRP, deploying EDR, encrypting devices, establishing regular security training, and validating backup recoverability will significantly improve the school's resilience against modern cyber threats." \

The school demonstrates mature practices through **comprehensive MFA enforcement**, **air-gapped backups**, and **regular security training**, but key vulnerabilities remain in **Incident Response** and **Endpoint Security**. Specifically, the absence of a **formal Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP)**, lack of **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**, and **limited endpoint encryption** present elevated risks to timely detection and recovery. Strengthening these areas by implementing a CIRP, deploying EDR, encrypting devices and establishing a backup validation process will significantly enhance the school's readiness and resilience against modern cyber threats." \
